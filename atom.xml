            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;morganbrown&#x2F;&quot;&gt;David Morgan-Brown&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patchwork.health&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Patchwork Health&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I had the opportunity to do something I’ve genuinely missed: presenting in front of a live audience. The subject? Orchestrators, the latest buzzword currently dominating the AI landscape.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may know the concept by another name: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;steveyegge&#x2F;gastown&quot;&gt;Gas Town&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Since its release last Christmas, its popularity has (predictably) &#x27;hockey-sticked&#x27;, and become the reference of other orchestrators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attached the presentation slides below. The first part provides a recap of the architectural steps that moved us here. We trace the path from small agentic loops, through Ralph (July 2025, which feels like an eternity ago!), to the Orchestrator itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part focuses on the business impact. Let&#x27;s be realistic: I don&#x27;t expect this to be a choice. With tools like Claude Code enabling orchestrator building blocks natively in the coming releases, this technology will find its way into most software companies. I suspect that, much like early LLM adoption, if you believe your team isn&#x27;t using it, you are likely mistaken.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are venturing into new territory. I don&#x27;t believe we have established best practices for these advances yet. I&#x27;ve listed some emerging patterns in the slides, but the balance has shifted. There is so much more code and, consequently, much more risk. I doubt some traditional best practices will survive this change, and I expect accepting new ways of working will be challenging in some environments. Not to talk about those which are still trying to implement Agile since 2005...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New practices will be a major theme for us to tackle in 2026. I&#x27;m very curious about the outcomes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/durable-computing-hype/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Durable computing has emerged as a topic in systems design. It may just be my bubble, but it feels as if, suddenly, AI stopped being the next big thing and durable computing is going to solve all our problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed some misunderstandings about the concept. Thus, I&#x27;m taking this chance to pen some explanation on what durable computing is, and why you should care. Or not. Let&#x27;s start.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process-to-durable-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-process-to-durable-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-process-to-durable-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The process to durable computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it is very important to understand the technological steps that brought us a technology. Otherwise, you end up with people not understanding that LLMs have randomness at their core. So I will start by tracing the origins of durable computing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first appearance of durable computing is something you are likely familiar with: database transactions. Jim Gray&#x27;s seminal work on transactions and two-phase commit in the 1970s built the foundation for the first transactional systems with ACID semantics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transactions are a self-contained sequence of steps that either &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happen or &lt;em&gt;none&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happen, guaranteeing that the data stays consistent no matter what. This is also the core idea behind durable computing: preservation of state, and managing failure gracefully so that state doesn&#x27;t degrade.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step came with the workflow engines of the 1990s. Microsoft BizTalk and similar products moved from handling atomic operations to managing long-running processes that could span arbitrary amounts of time. Like with transactions, these workflow engines are still in use. The concepts behind them are the foundation of a lot of current tooling, like some products for microservices orchestration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big step (pun not intended). At this stage, we don&#x27;t rollback a few operations; we track state across multiple tasks, which may include interactions with other systems and human approval. The complexity is readily apparent, as we need to be able to respond to events and correct errors in the middle of a workflow without corrupting the state.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with workflow engines is that they are complex products. There are tradeoffs to using them. This meant that some developers looked for simpler alternatives, and they found them when message queues (like RabbitMQ) and the Event Sourcing pattern started becoming more popular. Together, they enable a developer to achieve durability by ensuring message delivery even on consumer failure, while reducing the complexity of maintaining the system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change has some nuance, though. We move from a single monitoring system to multiple independent systems. Each service may use a database to handle internal state via transactions, maybe using STM (Software Transactional Memory) libraries. Communication with other services happens via queues, in asynchronous fashion. With both, we achieve durability and decoupling, and each piece is simple to manage. But it is harder to get a view of the global state, as it involves more components.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in some cases, queues are not enough. Some operations must be synchronous. For example, booking a trip. As we enter the era of microservices, we may have distributed transactions that span multiple other services, and the required synchronicity of the operation means we can&#x27;t use queues for durability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, and the last step in this evolution towards durable computing, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microservices.io&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;data&#x2F;saga.html#example-choreography-based-saga&quot;&gt;Saga pattern&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. A mechanism to manage distributed transactions in microservice architectures. Sagas break down long-running processes into a series of smaller, local transactions, each with a corresponding compensating transaction that can undo its effects if something goes wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sagas are a great insight building on top of all the previous experience. The compensation mechanism ensures that we don&#x27;t corrupt the state, and we can always retry from the point where a failure occurred. For those using existing durable computer services, this is the pattern that services like Temporal.io force you to follow when you declare a workflow with AddCompensation steps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s how we reached durable computing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-that-really-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#is-that-really-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: is-that-really-it&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Is that really it?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&#x27;s it. Durable computing is a simple concept, albeit not an easy one to implement correctly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional computing operates on the principle that a program&#x27;s state exists only while it&#x27;s running. When the program stops, its state is lost unless explicitly saved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durable computing, in contrast, automatically preserves program state across failures, restarts, and even machine boundaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need an example? Think Microsoft Word (running locally) vs. Google Docs. With Word, you need to save (or enable Autosave) to avoid losing your progress due to an unexpected crash. With Google Docs, data is automatically preserved, and you can recover without losing state after a crash .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the concept is simple. The implementation, however, is not. When implementing durable computing patterns, you&#x27;ll inevitably face CAP theorem tradeoffs. For instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saga Pattern implementations often sacrifice immediate consistency for availability. When a distributed transaction is in progress, different services might temporarily show different states. This is a direct consequence of choosing AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) over C (Consistency).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event Sourcing systems typically favor eventual consistency, making them AP systems. This means they can continue operating during network partitions, but there&#x27;s a window where different parts of the system might see different states. This is particularly relevant in globally distributed systems.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some durable computing platforms attempt to provide CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance) guarantees by using consensus protocols like Paxos or Raft. While this ensures strong consistency, it can impact availability during network partitions. Temporal.io uses this approach.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these tradeoffs is crucial when choosing your durable computing implementation. For example, a financial system might require strong consistency and choose to sacrifice some availability, while a content delivery system might prefer high availability with eventual consistency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the core concept remains as explained in the previous section. It&#x27;s not a revolution but an evolution, and platforms that market themselves as durable computing solutions are simply making certain choices for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-a-business-care&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-a-business-care&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-a-business-care&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Why should a business care?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology spiel is very nice, but in the end, we serve a business. Should it care? The answer is yes. This is important for the same reason transactions are important for a business. You want data integrity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some business processes may take a long time and require manual approval of some steps. Others must be synchronous, due to customer expectations or the nature of the process itself. In both cases, data consistency is important. But modern applications consist of multiple services, which make ensuring that consistency harder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the concept of durable computing is something important, even critical, to your business. That said, what you care about is the data integrity part. The label, not so much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caring about data integrity also surfaces another truth: not all your systems need to be durable, implementing all the patterns we mentioned. Let&#x27;s not forget that adding compensating mechanisms makes the code more complex, to start with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, durable computing patterns themselves add overhead to the system. Event Sourcing adds I&#x2F;O overhead, event replay can increase latency, and consensus protocols in CP systems (as discussed above) can require multiple round trips.
State reconstruction takes time. Due to all these factors, among other unmentioned issues, it is not unusual to see performance drops as high as 20%. This has direct cost implications, as more (or larger) servers are needed to provide the same service.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are business processes which are fine with eventual consistency and Event Sourcing alone. For other processes, discarding the full task and starting again may be a valid step. Using durable computing for them can be a waste of resources, both developer time and compute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, only a few business processes will benefit from durable computing. But for those cases, we want to ensure that we are resilient to errors, and we want to implement all the patterns we can to avoid problems later on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-add-durable-computing-to-my-system&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#can-i-add-durable-computing-to-my-system&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: can-i-add-durable-computing-to-my-system&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Can I add durable computing to my system?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many options for you to start using durable computing without having to migrate to a specific platform. Start using Event Sourcing if you are not doing so, and the Saga pattern on relevant operations in your services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using the JVM, the Axon framework provides a SagaEventHandler annotation, among others, for Saga management. Or you can use Akka, which provides persistent actors which are, in essence, durable computing interfaces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Go, there are libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;itimofeev&#x2F;go-saga&quot;&gt;Go-Saga&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to help you. You will likely find equivalent libraries for your language of choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AWS users, you can rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;step-functions&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Step Functions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a mechanism for durable computing. Just beware, as at scale they are expensive even by AWS standards. Azure has the equivalent functionality with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;azure-functions&#x2F;durable&#x2F;durable-functions-overview?tabs=in-process%2Cnodejs-v3%2Cv1-model&amp;amp;pivots=csharp&quot;&gt;Durable Functions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of the Cloudflare ecosystem can rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;building-workflows-durable-execution-on-workers&#x2F;&quot;&gt;workflows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in their workers, along with Durable Objects, for durable computing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, you probably don&#x27;t need to migrate to a new platform or learn a new language. It is completely possible to achieve this with your current stack and provider.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many new platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temporal.io&quot;&gt;Temporal.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that promote themselves as the true way to achieve durable computing. They may be better in some cases, and they will provide bells and whistles that may make the developer experience simpler. Just beware of the costs of adopting a new technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important note on the above: I&#x27;ve seen the proliferation of several services that promote themselves as the only true way to do durable computing. Due to some cursed history I wish I wasn&#x27;t aware of, I suspect a few are not being honest with their marketing or benchmarks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is my way of saying that, please, test your use cases properly. Those services may charge you a premium over what you could already achieve in-house with existing tools. They may be worth it. But don&#x27;t trust their word at all. Run your tests, your failure scenarios, before you commit to using them. Evaluate if you can do the same in your current platform and stack. Worst case, you are then convinced they fulfill your needs. Best case, you avoid a headache later on, when their marketing reveals itself empty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;that-s-all&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#that-s-all&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: that-s-all&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
That&#x27;s all&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of durable computing is not a complex concept, nor something as innovative as it may seem at first glance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for a business. There is also a lot of marketing muddling things, as we are prone to do in the software world. But data consistency matters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is not if you need durable computing. The question is if you need a new platform to achieve it. Avoid all hype, always test and verify first.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/cloud-exit-mirage-aws-alternatives/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a trend that has been going on for a while now. Companies &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;migrate-to-self-hosting&#x2F;&quot;&gt;announce&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; they are leaving &quot;The Cloud&quot; (meaning, usually, AWS), for huge savings. This seems counter to all they have ever told us about the benefits of the cloud. But a lot of people seem to be copying the cool guys. In an industry where new trends get adopted without a second thought that is not a surprise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that you are not copying trends thoughtlessly, then the question is: should you do it? And, if so, where should you go? In this post I&#x27;ll summarise some of the reasons why the Cloud has lost its appeal for some companies, and what alternatives there are.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-incumbent&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-incumbent&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-incumbent&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The incumbent&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Cloud&quot;, in effect AWS and a sprinkle of GCP and Azure, have dominated the landscape for many years. There is a generation of developers that have never known a world without it: EC2 came into public beta in 2006. 18 years ago.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not going to rehash &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;28&#x2F;how-amazon-ec2-grew-from-a-notion-into-a-foundational-element-of-cloud-computing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the history&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the first services offered by AWS, like EC2 and S3. What we need to remember is what was the status-quo at the time. When you needed a server, you couldn&#x27;t just get one. You had to buy one of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delltechnologies.com&#x2F;asset&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;servers&#x2F;technical-support&#x2F;poweredge-r260-spec-sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;these&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, get it delivered in a few weeks if lucky, get space in your data center, and go to install it. Compare that with doing a few clicks on a website and waiting 15 minutes. It was revolutionary: cheaper and faster than the current way of working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud had another benefit: it allowed turning CAPEX into OPEX. Not long after, the post-2008 financial crisis period and the ZIRP environment started. That meant it was a better choice for companies to use the cloud. This is important: capital preservation was a key motivation for moving towards the cloud&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as the Cloud became more and more popular, complexity arrived. Over a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BtJAsvJOlhM&quot;&gt;hundred new services&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in AWS. &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; release. Serverless. In the meantime, no real competitor appeared for AWS, with GCP and Azure still far behind in market share even today. All this had consequences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-broken-promises&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-broken-promises&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-broken-promises&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The broken promises&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud delivered value, that can&#x27;t be argued with. Many companies wouldn&#x27;t be possible without it. Why, then, this growing disenchantment with it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it would be unfair to not acknowledge that the customers themselves share some of the blame. As I mentioned before the industry loves copying, particularly anything that big tech does. This is how we ended with companies using Hadoop or Spark for Big data, despite their big data fitting in memory in a single machine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the issue is that the original promises of the cloud are currently not true. The AWS cloud was a better and cheaper way to provision servers. That&#x27;s not such a clear proposition anymore, at least with the hyper-scale cloud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big issue is the value for money proposition. The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ec2&#x2F;latest&#x2F;instancetypes&#x2F;co.html&quot;&gt;instance types page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in AWS shows that a C5.large instance is using a CPU architecture from 2017, with 4Gb of RAM, at $0.085. For comparison, Hetzner offers a server with a CPU from the same year and 8 GB of RAM at €0.0238 ($0.03 at current rate). For the $0.08 that AWS costs, you can get dedicated servers with 64Gb RAM and a CPU from 2023. This server performs 2x better in single core tasks, and 40% better in multithreaded tasks. I&#x27;m &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;anilgarggiit_recently-during-a-cloud-implementation-for-activity-7232650822491238400-4JEw&#x2F;&quot;&gt;not the only one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; noticing the disparity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, you get a much worse deal with AWS. Hetzner is one example, but there are other providers (Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr, and so on) with the same advantages. Yes, Amazon has saving plans with use commitment, but it is not the only platform that offers that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost issue goes further than that. AWS surprise bills are not uncommon, to the point that there are &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lastweekinaws.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an-aws-free-tier-bill-shock-your-next-steps&#x2F;&quot;&gt;articles&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; explaining what to do when it happens. And the billing can be so confusing that whole &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckbillgroup.com&quot;&gt;companies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; exists to help you manage that part of your operations. To be fair, runaway costs are &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;shoeboxdnb&#x2F;status&#x2F;1643639119824801793&quot;&gt;not exclusive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to AWS, with some serverless providers being another notorious culprits. But it is a big risk for a smaller company.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that I mention serverless, there are also broken promises with serverless. Serverless should be about not caring about scaling your app, either up or down. The price per hour is more expensive, but you only pay for the real use. So it ends up being cheaper (unless you have 24&#x2F;7 use, in which case you want an EC2 instance). That should mean that the service scales down to 0 when no one is using it. That is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lastweekinaws.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;no-aws-aurora-serverless-v2-is-not-serverless&#x2F;&quot;&gt;not always true&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This muddling of the name comes along another issue, specific to serverless in AWS. The proliferation of services mean you may end up with architecture diagram like this one:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net&#x2F;ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;11&#x2F;main_architecture_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of serverless argue this is exposing the real complexity of the app. It may be, but these components add very strong coupling and contribute to vendor locking. Additionally, all these extra services are billable. In several cases the billing rules are arcane. The end result is an increase of the cost of running the application.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise: the cloud provided economic advantages, without extra development work. But, recently, the value proposition doesn&#x27;t seem to be there anymore. And the complexity around some services has increased, making the benefits of the trade-off less clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;swapping-clouds&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#swapping-clouds&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: swapping-clouds&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Swapping Clouds&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is The Cloud (understood as AWS) bad, then? No, of course not. If you are a company like Netflix, it makes sense to use this flavour of the cloud. Or if you have specific regulatory compliance needs (say, HIPAA). Or for many other scenarios.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that too many companies use AWS because it is the default. We underestimate the power of inertia. When most of the industry uses Terraform, AWS (or similar platforms), and Kubernetes, what will they choose for their next project?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we also underestimate how much it is possible in modern hardware. The days of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C10k_problem&quot;&gt;C10K&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are far behind. WhatsApp was serving &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.whatsapp.com&#x2F;1-million-is-so-2011&quot;&gt;2 million connections&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from a single server, in 2012. Pieter Levels was running &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.io&#x2F;how-i-build-my-minimum-viable-products&#x2F;&quot;&gt;all his startups&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a single Linode box, in 2014. StackOverflow run the site &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacenterdynamics.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;stack-overflow-still-on-prem-runs-qa-platform-off-just-nine-servers&#x2F;&quot;&gt;in just 9 servers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, taking advantage of vertical scaling. More than 8 years ago, computers were already powerful, imagine nowadays.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era where servers with dedicated CPU are not expensive, and the hardware can do so much more, it is time to rethink our infrastructure. Yes, there is no silver bullet, but do we need to go all-in with AWS? Are there no alternatives for us?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to clarify what I&#x27;m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; proposing. I&#x27;m not telling you to go back to on-prem. Yes, that &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221_our-cloud-exit-savings-will-now-top-ten-million-activity-7252755548859727874-k5V2&quot;&gt;DHH post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with their savings by doing moving to om-prem is popular. It works for them, but it is not sure if it will work for you. There is a set of pre-requirements to do that, which are not universal. From staff that has experience managing the servers in the data center, to CAPEX capability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am suggesting is to look at alternatives to AWS, and understand if there is a reason why you could not use them. Companies running applications in AWS connect routinely to SaaS offerings like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aiven.io&quot;&gt;Aiven&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.papertrail.com&quot;&gt;Papertrail&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.honeycomb.io&quot;&gt;Honeycomb&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. They get extra functionality outside AWS, using AWS mainly for their compute workloads. Is there a reason you must pay more for a worse compute service? Is there some critical service in AWS itself you need and forces that decision? Or can you move away?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show you what I mean, by going over alternatives you have depending on your preferences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-really-like-aws-gcp-azure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#you-really-like-aws-gcp-azure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-really-like-aws-gcp-azure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
You really like AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You like The Cloud, you have nightmares thinking about the times before EC2. Or, maybe, you have never experienced an alternative way of doing things. You would need convincing to leave your walled garden.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is understandable, and I&#x27;m not going to say it is a mistake. But I would suggest that you develop a framework to test if it may be worth considering other options. I am going to write an example next. It is an example, it is not exhaustive, and it should be adapted to the reality of your business. But it will give you an idea of what to ask:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your compliance needs? If you need HIPAA, working in AWS may be easier. For SOC2, alternative platforms are good enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you need global presence? If you only serve one region (for example, Europe), multi-region is less valuable. For global presence, current edge solutions like Fly.io or Cloudflare may be enough. Or your business may need multi-region AWS for other reasons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your usage patterns? Predictable workloads, with little change between peak and off-peak, work well with dedicated servers. Very volatile or event-based traffic is more cost-effective with serverless or cloud elasticity. If you use a lot of spot instances, the economics may not differ that much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much are you spending in AWS now, and how much would it cost in another platform? How much engineering effort you need to move? If it takes a huge effort, you may not recover the cost in a long while, making the investment not worthy. But what if the break even point is just 6 months? It turns into a more enticing proposition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the skills of your team? If you needed to hire people to make this happen, then it is not an option. You can (and should) upskill the team, but that will increase the total cost of the migration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, those are some examples. You should ask yourself questions about the current infrastructure, team, and costs, and see if a move could work. Even if you are not planning to move, it may be a good exercise, helping you detect waste in your infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-like-kubernetes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#you-like-kubernetes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-like-kubernetes&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
You like Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is not my cup of tea, but it would be foolish to deny the tool. It is a industry standard for a reason. Now, you can be lucky and use managed Kubernetes in GCP, and there you will have a decent experience, compute premiums aside. But I&#x27;ve often heard that managed Kubernetes in AWS is, at best, subpar. AWS is the dominant cloud, which means it is likely your Kubernetes experience is not great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that is the case, and your operations team have the skills, you should look at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reclaim-the-stack.com&quot;&gt;Reclaim the Stack&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It is a Kubernetes-based deployment platform designed to work like a PaaS (think Heroku). It provides you with most of what you need: Gitops, Ingres, Databases, Observability, and more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-don-t-like-managing-servers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#you-don-t-like-managing-servers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-don-t-like-managing-servers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
You don&#x27;t like managing servers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ideal platform was Heroku, but that is not a good choice anymore. Managing a server is a big responsibility. Security updates, avoiding downtime, managing the load, and the myriad of tiny annoyances that come with the task. You could use Kubernetes, but then again that brings its own set of problems. You can try the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;Cloudflare:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the Cloudflare ecosystem is one of the most impressive for serverless I&#x27;ve seen up to now. More so considering the price, with a generous free allowance and a subscription that includes plenty of compute. Cloudflare Pages works out of the box with many popular frameworks, making deployment a breeze. And there are the extra services: databases (D1), storage (R2, cheaper than S3 and without transfer fees), Durable objects, and more. No, I&#x27;m not paid by Cloudflare, but I like their service.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;app-platform&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean Apps&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: you can deploy a Docker container or code from a Github&#x2F;Gitlab repository directly. You can also connect to the other services offered, like Redis, Postgres, local S3, etc. One of the closest replacements for Heroku that I&#x27;ve seen. That said databases can become expensive as traffic grows, and you need a more powerful setup.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com&quot;&gt;Render&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a service like Digital Ocean Apps, where you can deploy your app into managed nodes, with the option to add databases and other services. As Digital Ocean, it can become pricey at some level of use. But worth considering when you start.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;railway.app&quot;&gt;Railway&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is another app service. They provide an environment in which you can deploy many services, and you only pay per real use. The risk with this model is any unexpected costs. Luckily they provide the option of purchasing prepaid credits, which can limit exposure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special mention to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unison.cloud&quot;&gt;Unison&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a revolutionary service. Unison provides a supercomputer for your software. The tradeoff is that you need to code in the Unison language. In exchange, you don&#x27;t have to worry about deployments, versioning, and many other tasks that we have normalised in the era of the microservice. As it is common, it offers a free tier. I&#x27;d recommend you to check it out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-are-ok-with-some-infrastructure-work&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#you-are-ok-with-some-infrastructure-work&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-are-ok-with-some-infrastructure-work&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
You are ok with some infrastructure work&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing a server is ok, but you would like some automation. Tooling has improved, we are in 2024 after all. There are common operations that you should find preconfigured. You want to limit the time spent in Terraform and Ansible, while having more control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in luck, there are services for that too:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleavr.io&quot;&gt;Cleavr.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; : this service works on top of your servers, which you have to provision separately on a VPS (see the next section for that). But for $15 per month, you get the full package: securing servers, database backups, monitoring, push to deploy, and more. The downside? It&#x27;s geared to deploying node and php apps, so it won&#x27;t be as useful if you use other programming languages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloud66.com&quot;&gt;Cloud66&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an alternative to Cleavr. It allows you to work in any programming language as it supports Docker deployments, but in exchange it is more pricey ($25 per month). Besides that, the offering is similar, it manages the machines you provisioned in your VPS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coolify.io&quot;&gt;Coolify&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a service like Cleaver and Cloud66, but with an important difference: it is open source. So you can download it and host it yourself. Or you can contribute to the development, by using their cloud offering, which is very affordable. It offers a complete package of functionality, but the documentation for some functionality is lacking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dokku.com&quot;&gt;Dokku&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an opensource project that tries to reproduce the functionality of Heroku. It requires you to set it up in a server, and then you are ready to go, you can target other servers for deployment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&quot;&gt;Fly.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is slightly different. You can deploy applications with a single docker image, and scale them as needed, and you pay per usage. But you are responsible for any backup of data stored in the Fly Machines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-are-old-school-bring-the-bare-metal&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#you-are-old-school-bring-the-bare-metal&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-are-old-school-bring-the-bare-metal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
You are old school, bring the bare metal&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have seen the old times, with data centers and bare metal. You just want to provision servers faster, without having to travel to the location. You can handle the setup. I have good news for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gold standard currently is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hetzner.com&quot;&gt;Hetzner.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; It offers a variety of servers, from dedicated to managed to VPS, all via their web console.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not the only alternative. If you only care about VPS, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vultr.com&quot;&gt;Vultr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and many other providers have similar offerings . Choose your server and start working almost immediately. And, often, you can scale vertically as your workload grows without having to migrate the server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list above is not exhaustive. There are services I have not listed intentionally due to their reputation (many customers are unhappy), and others that I am not aware of. There&#x27;s no denial that we are spoiled for choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry defaults to AWS because, paraphrasing the old adage, no one has ever been fired by buying more AWS services. But the offerings in 2024 are not the ones we had 10 years ago, and it may be better for your project or company to look for an alternative platform. You may get better compute resources and save operational costs at the same time. And without taxing your teams with extra engineering work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Automerge your Scala Steward pull-requests</title>

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-steward-automerge/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you code in Scala, it is likely that you use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scala-steward-org&#x2F;scala-steward&quot;&gt;Scala Steward&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to keep your dependencies up-to-date. But merging all the pull-requests it generates is tiring. This blog post tries to solve that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note, the following instructions only work if you store your codebase in Github. Which is a safe bet, nowadays. If you use Gitlab or another system, you need to adapt the instructions to your platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#prerequisites&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: prerequisites&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Prerequisites&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need Administrator access to the repository. You need to tweak some settings in Github to allow for the automation,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An associated Github App, for your repository or organisation, must exist. To create one, follow steps 1 to 4 from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;actions&#x2F;scala-steward-github-action&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You don&#x27;t need to configure Scala Steward at this point. We provide the configuration required later on. But the secrets must exist in the repository.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need an existing Github action that builds your project. This must be set up to build any pull-request created in the project. Without it, we can&#x27;t know if a library upgrade breaks the codebase and if we can merge it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;repository-settings&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#repository-settings&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: repository-settings&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Repository Settings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, we need to change some settings in the repository.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and, in the &lt;code&gt;General&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; tab, scroll down to he &lt;code&gt;Pull Request&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; section. Make sure to select both &lt;code&gt;Allow Auto-merge&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Automatically delete head branches&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. If you see some options greyed out, that may be because you have an organisation that is using the free plan. In this case, you can&#x27;t enable auto-merge until you upgrade to a paid plan, sorry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, go to the &lt;code&gt;Branches&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; section and create a new &lt;code&gt;Branch protection rule&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Select your &lt;code&gt;main&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; branch as the target, or a branch where you usually merge your pull-requests. Then, select the following options:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Require a pull request before merging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Require approvals&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (set to 1) . Also  &lt;code&gt;Dismiss stale pull requests approvals&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Require status checks to pass before merging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. In the search box, find the Github action that builds your project. Keep &lt;code&gt;Require branches to be up to date&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; disabled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflows&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#workflows&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: workflows&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Workflows&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the changes to your repository settings. Now you need to add the following three workflows to your repository. You can copy the contents into the indicated files.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File: &lt;code&gt;autoapprove.yaml&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: Auto approve

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File: &lt;code&gt;scala-steward.yml&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          author-name: scala-steward
          author-email: scala-steward@example.com
          other-args: &amp;#x27;--add-labels&amp;#x27;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit and push the files, and you are ready to test this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;Actions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in your repository, select &lt;code&gt;Scala Steward&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and click on &lt;code&gt;run workflow&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Run it against the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; branch (or your corresponding branch). Once Scala Steward finishes, check your current pull-requests. You can open any new pull-request created, and see the build process and approvals. Once the build step finishes successfully, it will be merged. If a build fails, it will not be merged.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Mastodon&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/remote-build-servers-with-vs-code-and-metals/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;VS Code has released tooling &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;ssh&quot;&gt;for remote development via ssh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. In Scala the combo of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalameta.org&#x2F;metals&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Metals&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;VS Code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for development has become the norm for many people. How easy and convenient may it be to use them while on ssh with a remote server? Let&#x27;s discover it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-would-someone-do-that&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#why-would-someone-do-that&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-would-someone-do-that&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Why would someone do that&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all we should tackle an obvious question: why would a developer do that? The answer is that there are many valid scenarios for this approach:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone may work in a big corporation that gives lower-end Windows laptops, but has several servers available for developers to use&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone may not have enough budget to replace their aging laptop, and it is looking at the cloud as a cheaper alternative&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an employer has Intellectual Property concerns and would like tight controls on where is the codebase cloned to&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a developer uses mainly a desktop and they don&#x27;t want to buy a powerful laptop, but recently they need to travel more and still code&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a developer is fed up with seeing iStats show 90+ C degrees on the cpu sensor of their laptop, sustained while sbt compiles the project&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if none of them applies, just because we can. We&#x27;ll talk about cost-effectiveness of this approach towards the end of the post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-your-environment&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#setting-up-your-environment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: setting-up-your-environment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Setting up your environment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this work you will need:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a local machine capable of running Visual Studio Code.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a remote server, preferably with Linux (we use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to read and follow the steps in this post, adapting as needed if you use a different OS on your remote host.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements for Visual Studio Code &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;Docs&#x2F;supporting&#x2F;requirements&quot;&gt;are quite low&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, remember that the heavy lifting (compiling) won&#x27;t be done in the local machine, so even old laptops should work fine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you have some internet exposed desktop or server that you can use as the remote host. If you don&#x27;t have any at hand, look at a VPS service like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hetzner.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Hetzner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We&#x27;d recommend against AWS or GCP as they seem to be more expensive for worse performance. This post will use Linode, for no other reason that we used it in the past and we were happy with it. No affiliation with the brand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important note: if you are creating a new account in a VPS, expect to provide a valid credit card number to cover for the costs of any usage. There may also be a delay while they verify your account details; a new account via a UK-based Ltd company with Linode took 30m to be verified.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-your-remote-developer-instance&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#creating-your-remote-developer-instance&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: creating-your-remote-developer-instance&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Creating your remote developer instance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, provision an instance for the server if you need it. We use &lt;code&gt;Linode Dedicated CPU&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instances as they are supposed to have better CPU performance. You can follow &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;platform&#x2F;dedicated-cpu&#x2F;getting-started-with-dedicated-cpu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;these steps&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to create one. We chose the following settings:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Region: London&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan: Dedicated 8 Gb (4 cores, 8 Gb RAM)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide root password and ssh key for your local machine&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisioning takes around one minute, and then you can ssh into the box with &lt;code&gt;ssh root@&amp;lt;ip&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important note: on new accounts with Linode, you need to open a ticket with support to enable Dedicated 16 Gb and Dedicated 32 Gb Linode for your account. Otherwise you won&#x27;t be allowed to create those instances. Other VPS may have similar rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the machine is up, ssh into it. The next step is to install a valid JDK. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;adoptopenjdk&#x2F;adoptopenjdk-rpm-and-deb-files-7003ba38144e&quot;&gt;Adopt OpenJDK&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by running the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; wget -qO - https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io&amp;#x2F;adoptopenjdk&amp;#x2F;api&amp;#x2F;gpg&amp;#x2F;key&amp;#x2F;public | sudo apt-key add
&amp;gt; add-apt-repository --yes https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io&amp;#x2F;adoptopenjdk&amp;#x2F;deb&amp;#x2F;
&amp;gt; apt-get update
&amp;gt; apt-get install adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then edit your &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and add an export for &lt;code&gt;JAVA_HOME&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;export JAVA_HOME=&amp;#x27;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;jvm&amp;#x2F;adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot-amd64&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x27;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want to increase the number of file descriptors available to avoid issues with VS Code and large projects. To that end, edit &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;sysctl.conf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
and add to the bottom of the file &lt;code&gt;fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;sysctl -p&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to reapply the changes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (for &lt;code&gt;scala.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), which we can install as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; echo &amp;quot;deb https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;dl.bintray.com&amp;#x2F;sbt&amp;#x2F;debian &amp;#x2F;&amp;quot; | sudo tee -a &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;apt&amp;#x2F;sources.list.d&amp;#x2F;sbt.list
&amp;gt; apt-key adv --keyserver hkp:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
&amp;gt; apt-get update
&amp;gt; apt-get -y install sbt npm
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to work with Github, you will need to add the ssh public key of this instance to your profile. To generate a key, run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &amp;quot;your_email@example.com&amp;quot;  # don&amp;#x27;t add a password
&amp;gt; cat ~&amp;#x2F;.ssh&amp;#x2F;id_rsa.pub
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the output of the last command and add it to your SSH key list in Github.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the last step, clone the repository of &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; so that we can run some tests on it later:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git clone git@github.com:typelevel&amp;#x2F;cats.git
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these, your remote server should be ready to run scala code. As the next step, we need to connect a VS Code instance to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;connecting-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#connecting-visual-studio-code&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: connecting-visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Connecting Visual Studio Code&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open your VS Code and install the extension &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh&quot;&gt;Remote - SSH&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Then follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;ssh&quot;&gt;official documentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to connect to the remote server:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open the &lt;code&gt;Remote Explorer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; menu and add your server&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once configured, you can &lt;code&gt;connect&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to the server. This will open a new VS Code window. The bottom panel will show (on the left side) that you are connected to a remote server&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extensions are (usually) installed on the server, which means you will need to reinstall Metals. Open the &lt;code&gt;Extensions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; panel, in there you will see that extensions are split between &lt;code&gt;local&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Scroll the &lt;code&gt;local&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; list and press the green &lt;code&gt;install in ssh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; button for all those extensions you want to enable on your remote machine.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you haven&#x27;t done so, search for &lt;code&gt;Metals&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and install it. Then reload the window.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit VS Code settings for Metals, on the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; section for your remote machine set the proper path for &lt;code&gt;Java Home&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Metals&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (see previous section of this post for the path). This will require another reload of VS Code.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you installed the &lt;code&gt;Live Share&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; extension, you may be prompted to install additional components, which requires yet another window refresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;loading-your-project&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#loading-your-project&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: loading-your-project&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Loading your project&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the VS Code window has reloaded and reconnected to the server, you can just go to &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; Open&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and select the &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project you cloned when setting up the server.
Metals will let you know that this is an &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project and it will request to load it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it. Once Metals completes the set up, you are ready to go and code as you are used to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: Note that any &lt;code&gt;terminal&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; you open while in the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; window will open directly in the remote server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;backing-up-your-remote-server&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#backing-up-your-remote-server&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: backing-up-your-remote-server&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Backing up your remote server&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you want to create an image of your server. Note that Linode (and most other platforms) will still charge you for the box if you stop it, as it is still provisioned for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce costs what you want is to have an image with the latest changes to your server, which you can do &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;platform&#x2F;disk-images&#x2F;linode-images&#x2F;&quot;&gt;following these steps&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Building the image took less than 2 minutes for our server. Once you have the image, you can delete your instance and create a new one when needed, using that image as a starting point. The image will keep the same ssh public key, which means you can interact with Github using your account without any additional steps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in Linode you have some restrictions on images but even so this should be enough for your purposes. Alternatively, you could use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;platform&#x2F;stackscripts&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stack Scripts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or some other automated system to create images on demand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#performance&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Performance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have everything set up, we need to verify how fast is this setup. How does it compare to running everything locally? To test this we downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typelevel&#x2F;cats&quot;&gt;cats&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and we run &lt;code&gt;;clean;test&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; a few times. The following is a completely non-scientific table of the measurements:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Machine&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Avg&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Macbook 16&quot; late 2019 (8 cores)&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;3:28&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linode 4 cores&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Error&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linode 8 cores&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;11:48&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linode 16 cores&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;4:46&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Linode instances are &#x27;Dedicated CPU&#x27; instances. On the &#x27;Linode 4&#x27; instance,&lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; was often killed by the OS when running alongside VS Code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s be realistic, the performance is worse. The fastest Linode test, using the 16 cores machine, is over 1 minute slower than a test using a local environment. Unless you have a remote server you own and with a decent cpu, you are going to lose at least some performance. But it&#x27;s not too terrible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-hydra&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#enter-hydra&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: enter-hydra&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Enter Hydra&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that we are trying to find a way to run compilation in remote servers for cases where a local setup is not an option. Maybe we can improve on it? &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;triplequote.com&quot;&gt;Triplequote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; offers &lt;code&gt;Hydra&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, a parallel compiler for Scala. This would increase costs, but can this turn it into a viable alternative?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.triplequote.com&#x2F;trial&#x2F;sbt&#x2F;&quot;&gt;instructions for a trial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Hydra&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and we run the tests again in Linode. The trial license uses a &lt;code&gt;Developer (Enterprise)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; license which can take advantage of up to 8 cores.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Machine (with Hydra)&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Avg&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linode 8 cores&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;6:39&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linode 16 cores&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see Hydra makes a big difference as it is able to take advantage of the number of cores available. In the lower spec Linode we halve the compile time, while in the Linode with 16 cores we compile cats in a third of the time it originally took. The improvements would be similar in a local setup, but let&#x27;s remember that we are looking at scenarios where you need (want) to use a remote setup.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cost-of-the-setup&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#cost-of-the-setup&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: cost-of-the-setup&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Cost of the setup&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MacBook Pro 16&quot; 2019, with the maximum RAM (64 Gb) and CPU (8 core 2.4 Ghz) currently costs $3,799.00, taxes aside. Other non-Apple laptops and desktops will be cheaper, but I use this as a reference as it is the one many companies give to their developers, so it is a fair benchmark for comparison.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Linode (Dedicated CPU) with 8 cores and 16 Gb RAM costs USD0.18&#x2F;hour. For a standard work schedule of 45h per week and 50 weeks per year (and you should really work less than that), it adds up to USD8.1 per week, and USD405 for the year. Assuming the same use pattern, a Linode with 16 cores and 32 Gb of RAM (USD0.36&#x2F;hr) costs twice as much: $16.2 per week, USD910 per year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Developer - Enterprise&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; license for &lt;code&gt;Hydra&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; costs $1,080&#x2F;year per seat, to take advantage of up to 8 cores.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slower Linode with 8 cores, with Hydra, would cost $1,485&#x2F;year but it is twice as slow as the laptop we compare it with, which makes it a less appealing choice. Without Hydra the compilation times become too high to even consider it as an option.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the Linode 16 cores the story changes, as the performance is closer to what we get with a local machine. You could pay USD910 for the Linode instance and get compile times around 30% slower, but at 25% of the cost of the laptop. Or, if you add Hydra and increase the cost to USD1,990, you can be 60% faster than the laptop for around 50% of the price.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#conclusions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Conclusions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it cloud computing ready to become your development server? As with most things in development, it depends. If you need to squeeze every bit of performance
from your machines, then a local setup is still preferred. And you should get a Hydra license, period.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if not, you can get reasonable performance from dedicated machines. A Linode with 16 cores and without Hydra is a quarter of the price of a top of the shelf laptop,
and you still get reasonable performance. If you add Hydra on top, then we are looking at remote setups that outperform a local setup, while costing you less upfront. A hard-to-beat proposition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple caveats, of course. For example, the SSH extension for Visual Studio Code is still on &lt;code&gt;preview&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and there may be glitches. Also, things that are easily achieved with a local workflow may be slightly more complicated with a remote one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not many project will be as demanding as &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for compilation, due to its multiple compile targets. And there are other possible benefits, like being to replace docker services running locally by ones in remote servers, reducing pressure on the computer even more. Given that we would expect costs for
cloud computing to decrease as time goes by, this setup can only become better as time goes by. Yes, it is unlikely to beat a local setup on raw performance, but sometimes that is not the only constraint.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Serverless_computing&quot;&gt;Serverless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has been out there for a while, seemingly surviving the hype cycle. In fact it has recently received an upgrade of sorts with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edge_computing&quot;&gt;Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. In this blog post I write about my experience using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;about&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Workers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to build a worker that calculates simple linear regression over a set of data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to skip the blog post and just play with the code, download the source of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;edge-sample&quot;&gt;linear regression calculator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and run it in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cloudflare workers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
What is Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edge_computing&quot;&gt;Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a term that has evolved from the original concept. Originally it was coined with the raise of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_of_things&quot;&gt;IoT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the consequences of having thousands (or even more) devices connecting to your servers for each task. All these connections require network bandwith and server resources, which become expensive given the amount of connections we are talking about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution is to delegate some of these computation to the IoT devices themselves, so they don&#x27;t need to connect to the server. That is, given a network formed by the server and the IoT devices, we move some of the computations &#x27;to the edge&#x27; of the network, to the devices themselves. This comes with its own set of trade-off, as you need a more capable CPU in the IoT devices as well as building effectively a distributed computing cluster for some of your operations, but it reduces the requirements of bandwith and CPU of the central servers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term has been coopted by hosting and CDN companies, which now use it to refer to operations resolved in the &#x27;edges&#x27; of their own networks, which can comprise hundreds of nodes in several geographical locations. The edges selected to run the computation are usually the edges closer to the user generating the request, which as a consequence reduces latency considerably.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Edge is just an evolution of Serverless with simplified deployment across geographical areas and reduced latency for the user. The fact AWS offers both &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;edge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Lambda@Edge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; should be a clear hint of this. but with reduced latency for the end user due to having the server in a network closer to their physical location.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Edge Computing in Cloudflare&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edge Computing implementation in Cloudflare is called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;about&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Workers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You can deploy workers associated to a domain in Cloudflare, and have them execute on some or all of the requests against the domain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with JEE, they work similarly to Servlet filters. You receive the request and you can decide to either send a response or to forward the request to some underlying service. Note that there is no need for any underlying service to exist, the workers can generate a response by themselves. You can also take advantage of a KV store (currently in Beta).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code can be written in Javascript (not Node.js, mind you, but Javascript for V8 engine) or WebAssembly compiled from Rust. If that&#x27;s your choice, Cloudflare provides a tool &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;webassembly&#x2F;&quot;&gt;wrangler&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to facilitate working with your code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudflare-workers-vs-serverless&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#cloudflare-workers-vs-serverless&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: cloudflare-workers-vs-serverless&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Cloudflare Workers vs Serverless&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already several articles like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smashingmagazine.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;cloudflare-workers-serverless&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; comparing Workers and other offers like AWS Lambda.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the comparisons focus on the following benefits:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment is as easy (or even easier) as with AWS Lambda,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers are much cheaper than AWS Lambda. Workers bill per request, while Lambda bills for CPU used during the request. Running equivalent code in both can be 10x times cheaper in Workers&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers are much faster to start up and serve a request than Lambda, up to 8x times faster in some benchmarks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that some of the benefits like speed are due to the way Workers are constructed, using V8 directly instead of containers. This means you work with a faster but specialised platform in which you will only run  either Javascript or WebAssembly. If you want a platform that can support Go, Python, and others then Workers are not for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big difference between Lambda and Workers is execution time allowed for your function. In Workers the free tier gives you 5ms of CPU per request, while the top tiers provide 50ms. In Lambda you could take up to 30s to answer a request (although that would be quite expensive given you are billed per time spent). The smaller time windows allocated in workers justify running WebAssembly to make the most of it, but if your calls have to interact with several external components even WebAssembly won&#x27;t be enough and you should either stay in Lambda or consider if that call should be a function at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where Lambda has clearly the edge is the dashboard to manage your functions. Workers&#x27; dashboard needs some love: I am not able to see the execution time per request on my worker, and tasks like assigning routes to a worker are not intuitive. Furthermore, the editor is only supported in Chrome by default. There&#x27;s room for improvement here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern I have with workers is the process for managing QA environments or canary deployments. You can test your worker implementation using &lt;code&gt;wrangler preview&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; but I can&#x27;t find documentation on how to do a proper blue&#x2F;green deployment with Workers. Given that they sit in front of most of the requests to your app, this scares me a bit. A faulty deployment can have serious consequences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-to-use-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#when-to-use-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: when-to-use-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
When to use Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to acknowledge that I am skeptical of &#x27;serverless&#x27; as I feel it shares the same pitfalls of microservices, where we went from &#x27;everything must be a microservice&#x27; to &#x27;give me back my monoliths, please&#x27;. But it would be a mistake to ignore &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.troyhunt.com&#x2F;serverless-to-the-max-doing-big-things-for-small-dollars-with-cloudflare-workers-and-azure-functions&#x2F;&quot;&gt;compelling use cases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for which serverless or edge architectures can provide a tangible benefit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare documentation promotes many uses ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;hotlink-protection&#x2F;&quot;&gt;hotlink protection&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;a-b-testing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;A&#x2F;B testing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;workers&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;aggregating-multiple-requests&#x2F;&quot;&gt;request aggregation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And as per &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17447355&quot;&gt;this comment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordapp.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is making the most of Workers, using them to serve pre-rendered sites or even to override build artefacts sent to clients.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You usually don&#x27;t want to run long computations in Lambda, due to overall cost for execution, so the CPU restrictions in Workers shouldn&#x27;t matter much. In theory, most things you may want to run as a Lambda can be a fit for Workers. In practice there is a big difference: if your functions need to talk to external services, managing those requests may eat a lot of your CPU allocation in Workers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that, as it currently stands, there&#x27;s a subset of use cases which are not a good fit for Workers. You may want to split your code between both platforms, taking advantage of the cheaper and faster Workers for as many tasks as you can, while using Lambda for operations that rely heavily on 3rd party connections. But, of course, this comes with its own overhead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-we-please-talk-about-code&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#can-we-please-talk-about-code&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: can-we-please-talk-about-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Can we please talk about code?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, let&#x27;s talk about the code. As a test I&#x27;ve implemented a small &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;edge-sample&quot;&gt;linear regression calculator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheesyprogrammer.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;simple-linear-regression-from-scratch-in-rust&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to have some functionality that requires a lot of calculations to test the performance of WebAssembly in the Workers environment. Doing a simple linear regression fits the bill as we can work with the data the user sends each request in isolation and without requiring a database to store intermediate results.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;wrangler&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; tool that Cloudflare provides creates a template you can use to start building your worker. I won&#x27;t go over every line of the codebase, but we have the following main components:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modules &lt;code&gt;linreg&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;math&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheesyprogrammer.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;simple-linear-regression-from-scratch-in-rust&#x2F;&quot;&gt;simple linear regression post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. They are pure Rust code without any changes needed to make it work in WebAssembly, which is great as it shows that we can reuse our Rust libraries for our workers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file &lt;code&gt;worker.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is where we load our WebAssembly modules using specific API calls like &lt;code&gt;wasm_bindgen&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. It extracts values from the request received, sends them to the WebAssembly function, and returns a response to the user once the regression has been calculated. It also catches errors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file &lt;code&gt;lib.rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the entry point to our WebAssembly code, and the link between Rust and Javascript. We use some macros (&lt;code&gt;wasm_bindgen&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) to indicate this has to be compiled as WebAssembly. The code in the &lt;code&gt;linear_regression&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method itself is pure Rust, and we make use of the &lt;code&gt;linreg&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; module. Most of it would be standard Rust in another codebase,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference comes in the input and output types for the function, which are not the standard choices for Rust. Currently WebAssembly doesn&#x27;t work well with &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; so we need to define our input parameters as &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;[f32]&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which means we need to do some extra work to convert those into the &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; structures expected by our modules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue comes with the output parameters. Rust is not mapping &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; nor some structs to WebAssembly when returning them as a function result. As a consequence, if we want to return some complex data structure the easiest solution is to serialise it to Json, which we do using &lt;code&gt;serde&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Luckily this is not a complex process, but it is something to consider when planning what functions you want to define.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last question may be: why WebAssembly and not just Javascript? Why to do all this extra work, wiring Rust and Javascript, while we could do it all with pure Javascript?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about performance and how CPU is at a premium in Workers, due to restrictions on execution. That by itself may be a good enough reason. But there is more: WebAssembly has been considered by some as the realisation of what the JVM should have been, a &#x27;write once run anywhere&#x27; platform. Given that, it is not a bad idea to use any chance you have to evaluate this stack. If this prediction comes true, you may soon be compiling to WebAssembly all your code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#conclusions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Conclusions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge Computing as deployed by Cloudflare and other vendors is an evolution of Serverless with its own set of trade-off, on top of the ones you have by using Serverless. Workers allow you to improve performance and reduce cost on a subset of your Serverless calls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a great tool for developing your Worker&#x27;s code. Not only helps you obtain optimised code in a platform where CPU is at a premium, you can potentially share most of that code with the rest of your components.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Worker are currently not a full replacement of platforms like Lambda as they have some limitations, both in user experience (dashboard, blue&#x2F;green deployments) as in how much can you do within the allocated CPU time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected use case is to move some Lambda functions to Workers as a way to increase performance and reduce cost, while leaving other functions in AWS. If the benefits are worth the extra complexity, that will depend on your specific use case.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/playing-with-rust/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is not, at this stage, a new language. But I have to confess that I had not checked it out until now. I built a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;twitter_privacy&quot;&gt;small tool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to test it out. In this post I&#x27;ll briefly talk about how it felt working with Rust from the point of view of a Scala developer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skillsmatter.com&#x2F;conferences&#x2F;10488-scala-exchange-2018&quot;&gt;Scala Exchange&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I heard a lot of people talking about Rust. As a consequence, learning more about the language became a higher priority, as it is always good to listen to people with more experience :). It was also an excuse to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a bit more, to familiarise with its bindings so I can get the most out of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scalameta&#x2F;metals&quot;&gt;Metals&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn a new language is to build something with it, as that is the scenario when you hit all the common problems. What I wanted to avoid is to fight not only Rust but also some web framework or library on top of it. Time ago I built a tool to delete old tweets from my account, using Scala: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;twitter-privacy&quot;&gt;twitter privacy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It works well, but the nature of the program (running in a cron job once a day) makes it much slower than it should be, due to cold-start time of the JVM.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is known as a fast language, and a replacement of this tool using Rust seemed like a good fit for learning the language without having too many libraries involved. You can find the source code of the outcome  &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;twitter_privacy&quot;&gt;in github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and it has been published &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;twitter_privacy&quot;&gt;to cargo.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use it for your own social media maintenance, instructions on how to run it are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;twitter_privacy&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Readme.md&quot;&gt;Readme file&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Github.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-as-a-language&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#rust-as-a-language&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: rust-as-a-language&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Rust as a language&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Scala developer, I found Rust a very interesting language. For example, I&#x27;ve heard very often criticism towards the duality OO-FP of Scala,
pointing it was a bad decision. Rust clearly states in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;book&#x2F;&quot;&gt;their book&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that they support both, having a chapter dedicated
to each one, and on how to work in that particular way with the language.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has a very active community and very good documentation for their tooling and libraries. For example, check the documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;cargo&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it&#x27;s build tool. Or for one of the libraries I used, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tonberry.quietmisdreavus.net&#x2F;doc&#x2F;egg_mode&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;Egg_Mode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community is actively trying to exploit the advantages of Rust (speed, memory management). There&#x27;s a lot of work to build libraries using Rust in domains like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;arewegameyet.com&quot;&gt;game development&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arewelearningyet.com&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arewewebyet.org&quot;&gt;web development&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key area for Rust growth may be &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a binary format enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. Rust already compiles to it and has good tolling and  &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rustwasm.github.io&#x2F;book&#x2F;introduction.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This could enable a real &#x27;build once and deploy anywhere&#x27; development mode, without the issues caused by nuances of different platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general working with it felt familiar and there weren&#x27;t many unexpected surprises. The following comments come from someone which has been working extensively in the JVM world, with some non-professional experience in non-JVM languages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-good&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-good&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The Good&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the language and I felt comfortable with it, but there are some things worth of mention:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed. It&#x27;s been so many years using Scala that I forgot how fast can a CPU. Both compilation and execution are &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and help with keeping the development flow. No time for a small break on Twitter, or similar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typeclasses (using Traits). I got too used to Typeclasses and it would be hard to move to a language without them. The restriction on implementing instances of a Typeclass which doesn&#x27;t belong to your package have been a bit of a nuisance at some stages, but I understand the motivation behind that call, and it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo. It&#x27;s what &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; should be. The only tool you need as a developer to compile, test, benchmark, or publish to a central repository. Which, by the way, is a trivial to do (compared to the nightmare of publishing to Sonatype).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local documentation. The fact that you can, with a single cargo command, open the documentation of your dependencies for the specific version you are using is a life-saver. In this particular project the library that interacts with Twitter has changed a lot between the last published version and the current version under development, thus going to the online documentation could be very confusing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-less-good&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-less-good&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-less-good&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The Less Good&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is perfect, less so when you are experimenting with a new language. Some aspects that made the learning-curve harder:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifetimes. It&#x27;s one of the main features of Rust, it comes with major benefits, but it was a pain to manage. I had to refactor a lot of code because at the top level a closure would give me a lifetime error that I couldn&#x27;t fix. I guess with experience you get better at it, and it forces you to make smaller methods to avoid odd dependencies, but... it can be a pain. Garbage collection is a blessing, sometimes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semicolons. Used to Scala, having to add semicolons at the end of most of the lines wasn&#x27;t a great experience. The worst is exactly that &lt;em&gt;most of the lines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; part, as there are lines in which you don&#x27;t want semicolons as they change the meaning of the expression. Not hard to grasp, but feels like a step backwards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snake Case. Ok, it&#x27;s something minor, but after so many years in the JVM world, moving to Snake case wasn&#x27;t easy, habits die hard. And &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust-clippy&quot;&gt;clippy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was complaining non-stop about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger files. In Rust it is idiomatic to add your unit tests at the end of the file. The issue is that you end up having very long files, which are harder to navigate. It may be due to being used to the JVM way, but having a separate test folder with specific code in there feels, somehow, cleaner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#conclusions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Conclusions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that Rust is great for low level work, but currently it can&#x27;t replace a stack like &lt;code&gt;http4s&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; due to a lack of libraries supporting it. There are a set of community pages (the &lt;code&gt;AreWe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; pages, as seen before) that explain the progress in some areas. Looking at, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;areweasyncyet.rs&quot;&gt;Are We Async&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; one can see that today (February 2019) several &lt;code&gt;RFC&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are still in progress and some &lt;code&gt;unresolved&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; questions remain open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope they catch up soon, as the speed on both compilation and execution plus the FP support may make it a worthy alternative to Scala. But, right now, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my trusted tools for backend development, and dable with Rust only for specific needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;milessabin&#x2F;shapeless&quot;&gt;Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a type class and dependent type based generic programming library for Scala. It had its origins in several talks by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;milessabin&quot;&gt;Miles Sabin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and he has been the main contributor to the project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the community, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;milessabin&#x2F;shapeless&quot;&gt;Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is considered both as a stepping stone towards very advanced Scala constructs and a hard to learn (and to master) library. Unfortunately, Shapeless documentation is a bit sparse so users must find external resources to learn parts of the library.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim with this blog post is to provide a list of useful resources that may help you understand &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;milessabin&#x2F;shapeless&quot;&gt;Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and how your project can benefit from using it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-shapeless&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#why-shapeless&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-shapeless&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Why Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all you may want to know what are the benefits of using Shapeless. Is it only relevant for library authors, or is it a library you want to use on your production codebase?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;speakerdeck.com&#x2F;nigewarren&#x2F;introduction-to-shapeless&quot;&gt;slides&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;nigewarren&quot;&gt;Nigel Warren&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; show some realistic use cases for Shapeless. A short read that can give you an idea on what you could achieve with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JKaCCYZYBWo&quot;&gt;video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;valentinkasas?lang=en&quot;&gt;Valentin Kasas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalar-conf.com&quot;&gt;Scalar 2016&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; shows a practical use case of Shapeless and HList, with example code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above links are introductions to the library and, as such, limited in scope. But you can already see a common theme, via the use of HList constructs: to provide a single implementation that works with all your types, instead of one implementation for every single type.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has obvious advantages: less code means less bugs and less surface to be tested, while the fact it works for any case class makes the code more robust against new types introduced in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t deny the type signatures are a bit off-putting, but that is a small price to pay for the flexibility you can obtain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-business-case&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#a-business-case&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-business-case&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
A Business Case&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after reading the links above you may still be a Shapeless skeptic, with the belief that is a tool with little benefit &#x27;in the real world&#x27; (whatever that means to you). Confession time: I also was one, and it was a real-world issue at work what changed my mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenario is simple: we had a set of case classes representing different value types, and we needed to render them as Html, with reasonable expectations of adding many more types in the near future. So we wanted a simple way to convert exiting types plus any other type we would create later on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have read some tutorials on Shapeless you may recognise this case as a common example to introduce some of the functionalities of the library, and this is so for a good reason: Shapeless excels at this task.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not allowed to publish all the code, but you can see a relevant snippet below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;object ShowHtml {

  implicit val hnilEncoder: ShowHtml[HNil] =
    new ShowHtml[HNil] {
      def showHtml(t: HNil): NodeSeq = NodeSeq.Empty
    }

  implicit def hlistEncoder[H, T &amp;lt;: HList](
                            implicit
                            hEncoder: Lazy[ShowHtml[H]],
                            tEncoder: ShowHtml[T]
                          ): ShowHtml[H :: T] =
    new ShowHtml[H :: T] {
      def showHtml(hlist: H :: T): NodeSeq = hlist match {
        case h :: t =&amp;gt; hEncoder.value.showHtml(h) ++ tEncoder.showHtml(t)
      }
    }

  implicit val cnilEncoder: ShowHtml[CNil] =
    new ShowHtml[CNil] {
      def showHtml(t: CNil): NodeSeq = NodeSeq.Empty
    }

  implicit def coproductEncoder[H, T &amp;lt;: Coproduct](
                    implicit
                    hEncoder: Lazy[ShowHtml[H]],
                    tEncoder: ShowHtml[T]
                  ): ShowHtml[H :+: T] =
    new ShowHtml[H :+: T] {
      def showHtml(hlist: H :+: T): NodeSeq = hlist match {
        case Inl(h) =&amp;gt; hEncoder.value.showHtml(h)
        case Inr(t) =&amp;gt; tEncoder.showHtml(t)
      }
    }

  implicit def genericEncoder[A, R](
                   implicit
                   gen: Generic.Aux[A, R],
                   enc: Lazy[ShowHtml[R]]
                 ): ShowHtml[A] =
    new ShowHtml[A] {
      def showHtml(a: A) = enc.value.showHtml(gen.to(a))
    }


  implicit def stringShow: ShowHtml[String] = new ShowHtml[String] {
    def showHtml(t: String): NodeSeq = &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;{t}&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;ul&amp;gt;
  }

  implicit def booleanShow: ShowHtml[Boolean] = new ShowHtml[Boolean] {
    def showHtml(b: Boolean) = stringShow.showHtml(b.toString)
  }

  implicit def intShow: ShowHtml[Int] = new ShowHtml[Int] {
    def showHtml(n: Int) = stringShow.showHtml(n.toString)
  }
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t explain the code itself, that&#x27;s not the aim of this post and in any case it&#x27;s not complete. What matters is that this snippet is the core of a fragment of code that thanks to methods &lt;code&gt;hlistEncoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;coproductEncoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and related definitions will convert any case class in the codebase to HTML. This includes any future case class we create later on, no changes required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, it hardly gets better than this :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;effortless-shapeless&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#effortless-shapeless&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: effortless-shapeless&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Effortless Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not be convinced of the benefits of Shapeless (ok, keep reading then) or maybe you feel learning Shapeless requires an amount of effort and time you cannot spare. I have good news for you: you don&#x27;t need to learn Shapeless to benefit from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you browse the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;index.scala-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala index&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and search for &lt;code&gt;shapeless&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; you&#x27;ll see a lot of results. Besides Shapeless itself you will find entries like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;index.scala-lang.org&#x2F;alexarchambault&#x2F;argonaut-shapeless&quot;&gt;Argonaut Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which provides automatic derivation of codecs for your case classes&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;index.scala-lang.org&#x2F;typelevel&#x2F;shapeless-contrib&quot;&gt;Shapeless Contrib&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which enables integration of Shapeless with libraries like Scalaz, which benefit from automatic derivation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many more. These libraries make your coding experience easier by leveraging shapeless. But you are not exposed to Shapeless itself, that&#x27;s hidden from you. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;index.scala-lang.org&#x2F;alexarchambault&#x2F;argonaut-shapeless&quot;&gt;Argonaut Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides json codecs for your case classes automatically. So, as per the library documentation, this just works:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import argonaut._, Argonaut._, ArgonautShapeless._

sealed trait Base
case class First(i: Int) extends Base
case class Second(s: String) extends Base

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; encoding
val encode = EncodeJson.of[Base]

val json = encode(First(2))
json.nospaces == &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;{&amp;quot;First&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;i&amp;quot;:2}}&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; decoding
val decode = DecodeJson.of[Base]

val result = decode.decodeJson(json)
result == DecodeResult.ok(First(2))
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, no encoder nor decoder have been defined in the code, that being a tedious and repetitive task. Any new case class or ADT you add to your codebase benefits from this behaviour, automatically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using these libraries you will understand what Shapeless offers you much better, and they may be your &#x27;gateway library&#x27; to learning Shapeless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-shapeless&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#learning-shapeless&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: learning-shapeless&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Learning Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been convinced and want to learn Shapeless. Now what?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago that would mean scouring lots of links and blog posts online, to find information about the most recent release of the library. Nowadays there is a much straightforward solution, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;davegurnell&quot;&gt;Dave Gurnell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;underscore.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Underscore&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: read the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;underscoreio&#x2F;shapeless-guide&quot;&gt;Shapeless book&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a free ebook that explains how to use Shapeless, and it is a great book. Thanks Dave!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.47deg.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;47 Degrees&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have released &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-exercises.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala Exercises&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a free website where you can practice some of the Shapeless concepts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the cases not covered by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-exercises.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala Exercises&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scalafiddle.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala Fiddle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; allows you to select Shapeless as an available library (see &lt;em&gt;Libraries&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; section on the left-hand panel), so that you can test your Shapeless snippets online. Who needs an IDE?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can easily read documentation on Shapeless and solve some exercises to test your newly acquired knowledge. What&#x27;s your excuse? Go and start learning!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;additional-guides&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#additional-guides&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: additional-guides&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Additional Guides&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;underscoreio&#x2F;shapeless-guide&quot;&gt;Shapeless book&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-exercises.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala Exercises&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes learning Shapeless much easier, but I would be remiss if I dismissed other guides you can find online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very useful, when trying to learn a new and complex subject, to read many posts about the same idea. The repetition of the concepts breeds familiarity (hopefully without contempt!) with the concepts, and an array of examples allows for better understanding of the core ideas plus some of their nuances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim I recommend you to read the following posts, either before starting the book or as complementary documentation to flesh out the trickier concepts:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;skaalf&quot;&gt;Julien&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jto.github.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;getting-started-with-shapeless&#x2F;&quot;&gt;introduction to Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which describes (at a very high level) the main components of the library&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;evacchi&quot;&gt;Edoardo Vacchi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wrote a good &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rnduja.github.io&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;19&#x2F;a_shapeless_primer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;primer on Shapeless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that delves into a bit more detail than Julien&#x27;s article.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AKmetyuk&quot;&gt;Anatolii Kmetiuk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wrote a couple of posts that describe both &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akmetiuk.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;dissecting-shapeless-hlists.html&quot;&gt;HList&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akmetiuk.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;dissecting-shapeless-poly.html&quot;&gt;Poly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in much more detail.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;vlpavkin&quot;&gt;Vladimir Pavkin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; shows how to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pavkin.ru&#x2F;implementing-typesafe-request-builder&#x2F;&quot;&gt;implement a typesafe request builder&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; using Shapeless, a more practical example.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, lastly, if you want to see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;travisbrown&quot;&gt;Travis Brown&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; doing some magic with Shapeless to solve a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuler.net&#x2F;problem=2&quot;&gt;Project Euler problem&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; please read &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;31615371&#x2F;scala-shapeless-code-for-project-euler-2&#x2F;31640467#31640467&quot;&gt;this stack overflow answer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, these links are complementary to the book but worth reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stockfighter.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;StockFighter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a game by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;patio11&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Hi Patrick!) and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starfighters.io&#x2F;about&quot;&gt;others&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that makes you compete in a virtual Stock Exchange to accomplish certain objectives. They use it as a recruitment tool (kind of, read their website) but it&#x27;s a very entertaining game, even if you are not looking for a new job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stockfighter.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;StockFighter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Well, as you can guess from the title, because &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;tut&#x2F;freemonad.html&quot;&gt;Free Monads&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;! Care to join?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mission&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-mission&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-mission&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The Mission&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stockfighter.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;StockFighter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides an environment which is limited in scope, but still complex enough that showcases limitations&#x2F;strengths for a given tool. I&#x27;ve had in my backlog, for a looong while, the &lt;em&gt;mission&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of completing the game. Building an API to do so using Free seemed like the perfect match.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to build a Free Monad wrapper on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starfighter.readme.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stockfighter API&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ProjectSeptemberInc&#x2F;freek&quot;&gt;Freek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which allows us to solve the levels of the game. The API would only focus on the &lt;em&gt;Trading&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; part of the game as the other component, &lt;em&gt;Jailbreak&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, is not fully ready to be used.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#caveats&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: caveats&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Caveats&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, I want to make you aware that I am a beginner regarding Free. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about the subject, and I previously wrote two posts about them: &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;understanding-free-monads&quot;&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;freek-and-free-monads&quot;&gt;Freek and Free Monads&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a result of my research around the concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these posts approached the subject in a very theoretical way; they described how to build a Free Monad and potential applications, but you don&#x27;t really understand something until you have used it in production or, at least, in a realistic environment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first &lt;em&gt;real(ish)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; experience using Free for something more than a proof of concept, and as such I may have missed something obvious. If you believe so, please contact me via twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pvillega&quot;&gt;@pvillega&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) as I&#x27;m very keen on fixing gaps in my knowledge :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-implementation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-implementation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-implementation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The Implementation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing your code to the public is scary, isn&#x27;t it? Oh, well, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;stockfighter&quot;&gt;here you have it&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The code took longer than I wanted, as during its conception I realised several misconceptions I had regarding Free Monads and their implementation. I also experimented a bit with unrelated stuff which delayed this post &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; more. Ah, shiny baubles...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to start by opening &lt;code&gt;Introduction.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and reading it top to bottom, as it exposes the API and usage cases.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we ignore all the stuff not purely related to Free Monads, there are three files to focus on: &lt;code&gt;LogApi.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TradeApi.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;TradingAppHelpers.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-free-monads&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-free-monads&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-free-monads&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The Free Monads&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files &lt;code&gt;LogApi.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TradeApi.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; implement the Free Monads for the library. I won&#x27;t enter into the implementation details as they should be straightforward, and you can refer to my previous post on &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;freek-and-free-monads&quot;&gt;Freek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for guidance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to discuss is: why these two DSL and not more?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can argue about the abstraction levels, but I&#x27;ve come to these two as a natural evolution of the API. My initial idea was to build everything based on Free. When I say &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I mean it: my http calls would be a Free DSL (Get, Post, etc). Logs? Free. Free all the way down (and then turtles). It even sounded easy: Freek &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ProjectSeptemberInc&#x2F;freek&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;test&#x2F;scala&#x2F;AppSpec.scala&quot;&gt;examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; showcase a Log and Http DSL, so why not?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it may be possible, in fact it&#x27;s my next aim (v 2.0?) to experiment more around this area. But it makes things more complex than needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s take an example: Http DSL. Given the way natural transformations work, and that you want a generic DSL, you&#x27;ll end up with two DSL for your Http calls: a &lt;em&gt;request&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; one and one to manage &lt;em&gt;responses&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This is ok, the problem comes when you want to start defining &lt;code&gt;TradeAPI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; using these DSL.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural transformation converts a monad into another. Although Free is a monad, I had lots of problems trying to compile a Natural transformation from &lt;code&gt;TradeApi.DSL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that internally used &lt;code&gt;Http.DSL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, as it wasn&#x27;t a one-to-one transformation, but a one-to-for-comprehension transformation. It just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy solution was to implement the calls in &lt;code&gt;TradeApi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as for-comprehensions that used &lt;code&gt;Http.DSL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to define the behaviour. So &lt;code&gt;buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; would call the corresponding &lt;code&gt;Http.DSL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; helpers, and so on. Something like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def buy(stock: String) = for {
	body &amp;lt;- Post(buyUrl, toBody(stock))
	rsp &amp;lt;- DecodeResponse[OrderStatus](body)
} yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, though, we won&#x27;t have an interpreter for &lt;code&gt;TradeAPI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, only for &lt;code&gt;Http.DSL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. And there may be scenarios where we want to go that path. But, in this one, we may as well use our own interpreter for &lt;code&gt;TradeAPI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that manages the http calls and decoding inside, like a black box. We end up using a single interpreter anyway, but a slightly saner one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LogApi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; survived because, despite the option of doing the logging within the interpreter, it makes sense to allow the user to document the intention of programs built using &lt;code&gt;TradeAPI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the end, we only need these two. Yes, we could go deeper and replace &lt;code&gt;TradeAPI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; by several lower-level API, but the current form seemed simpler and more usable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;helper-class&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#helper-class&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: helper-class&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Helper class&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;TradingAppHelpers.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is mostly support methods and declarations: it defines the Onion we will use in our program, as well as some common methods like &lt;code&gt;run&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to abstract calling the interpreter for our program and managing the lifecycle of our http client (to avoid leaking connections). I believe the comments in the file suffice to explain the intentions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three parts of its code I want to elaborate a bit on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;onion-type&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#onion-type&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: onion-type&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Onion type&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we have the declaration for API and Onion, as usual when using Freek to work with several DSL at once.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;type API = LogApi.PRG :||: TradeApi.PRG
val API = Program[API]
type O = Result[?] :&amp;amp;: List :&amp;amp;: Bulb
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the Onion declaration, &lt;code&gt;O&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, includes both &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (an alias to &lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;List&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Without adding &lt;code&gt;List&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; I could not make it compile with result types of the form &lt;code&gt;Result[List[A]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effect of this is that using the Onion causes all the programs to return &lt;code&gt;Result[List[A]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; results. We can avoid this if we know we won&#x27;t use a call that return &lt;code&gt;Result[List[A]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; inside a program. In that case we may avoid the Onion and obtain just &lt;code&gt;Result[A]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; at the end (using &lt;code&gt;.freek&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;.freeko&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), but I&#x27;ve provided no helper methods similar to &lt;code&gt;run&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for this use case. Feel free to send a pull-request with one ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a better discussion on the matter in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mandubian&#x2F;freek&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;task-interpreter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#task-interpreter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: task-interpreter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Task Interpreter&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Task interpreter, the natural transformation from the DSL to &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, is declared as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def taskInterpreter(httpClient: &amp;#x2F;*...*&amp;#x2F;) = LogApiTaskInterpreter :&amp;amp;: new TradeApiTaskInterpreter(&amp;#x2F;*...*&amp;#x2F;)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this implementation &lt;code&gt;TradeApiTaskInterpreter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; depends on an &lt;code&gt;httpClient&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to be able to contact Stockfighter. Encapsulating the &lt;code&gt;httpClient&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; inside the interpreter is problematic, as we can&#x27;t control the lifecycle of the client itself. At no point during the natural transformation are you aware that this is the last step (unless you add an explicit &lt;em&gt;last step&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; command, but kind of defeats the point). Which means that closing your http connections needs to be done outside the interpreter itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds obvious, and it is. But the examples I&#x27;ve seen regarding interpreters and natural transformations showcase them as static objects with no dependencies, although the interpreters are the areas where we will perform side effects, like an http request. This mislead me, initially, to try to encapsulate everything inside the interpreter itself. I&#x27;m open to suggestions on improving the code, if you believe there&#x27;s a better way to manage the client.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;run-the-onion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#run-the-onion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: run-the-onion&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Run the Onion&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to run an interpreter on a given Onion is always the same, which means we can abstract it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def run[A](program: OnionT[Free, API.Cop, O, A], waitTime: Duration = 10 seconds) = {
    val client = new GigahorseHttpClientManager()
    try {
      val interpreter = taskInterpreter(client)
      val taskResult = program.value.interpret(interpreter)
      Await.result(taskResult.runAsync, waitTime)
    } finally {
      client.close()
    }
  }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the function &lt;code&gt;run&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instantiates its own &lt;code&gt;TradeApiTaskInterpreter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to manage the &lt;code&gt;httpClient&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, as discussed in the previous section.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant part of this code is the type of the parameter &lt;code&gt;program&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;OnionT[Free, API.Cop, O, A]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. It&#x27;s another obvious thing, but when I tried to generalise the signature from my existing programs the values &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; gave me didn&#x27;t compile properly due to several implicit-related errors. Freek uses quite a few of them implicits, and you can find yourself in a tangle trying to derive the implicit you need for your program. Next time, just copy this method&#x27;s signature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as I discovered a bit too late (to my chagrin) pay more attention when reading the Freek instructions. That type is declared in the Readme file. D&#x27;oh!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-freek&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-case-for-freek&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-case-for-freek&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The case for Freek&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explicitly comment on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ProjectSeptemberInc&#x2F;freek&quot;&gt;Freek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as it deserves all praise I can give it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience building these monads is a vindication for the library. Honestly, if you are going to use Free Monads in your code, add it to your dependencies. Right now. I&#x27;ll wait. Done?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the Cats approach I described in my old post about &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;understanding-free-monads&quot;&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to implement the API, stubborn in &lt;em&gt;keeping it simple and using few dependencies&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The pain was real, oh so real, when trying to work with the different answer types the DSL provides.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it didn&#x27;t work. Without Freek, the compiler was beating me. No chances, full surrender.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is not perfect. For example see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mandubian&#x2F;freek&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; related to the return types of Onions. It&#x27;s slightly cumbersome to having to manually peel responses each time you use the Onion. But given the alternative, I found it perfectly acceptable. And, come on, it&#x27;s barely version 0.6.0 and improving fast!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Scala magician at the level of Pascal, Travis, or Miles you may not need it. Otherwise, just use it and spend your valuable time in something else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-free-monads-for&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-free-monads-for&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-are-free-monads-for&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
What are Free Monads for&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the, arguably limited, experience I&#x27;ve had while building the API and running programs using it there are several things to consider when using Free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-monads-are-for-api&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#free-monads-are-for-api&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: free-monads-are-for-api&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Free Monads are for API&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free Monads are intended to abstract your API. You define your DSLs, you build a program that uses them, and your construct interpreters to match. They are not for doing business logic, though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by that?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read about them, my naive mind thought you could buy a stack of Free on top of Free and only at the end you&#x27;d use the interpreter, creating a kind of pure universe untouched by side effects. Crazy, maybe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s start by the fact that Free doesn&#x27;t (can&#x27;t?) implement &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. This removes the capability of using &lt;code&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; statements inside your for-comprehension. At some point in your application you&#x27;ll need to make decisions based on results, and avoiding &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; gets complicated, fast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, using the API provided try to create a program that buys a stock if the quote is lower than a value, and otherwise sells but only if you have enough shares and doing so would generate a benefit. Most likely you will end up with programs that mix Free statements with non-Free statements. You may argue the API is limited, so how complex do you want it to become to cover all particular once-off cases?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Free is great when you define a contract to hide implementation details. Think interfaces that do IO behind the scenes, or other side-effects, or combine calls to several services in one go. But it&#x27;s doubtful you&#x27;ll build your application (unless trivial) with &lt;em&gt;only&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ddd-ready&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#ddd-ready&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ddd-ready&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
DDD ready&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Domain-driven_design&quot;&gt;DDD&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is popular and you most likely use it. Bounded contexts and ubiquitous languages are a great fit for Free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your context is defined by a contract, an API that other components will use. Your logic will often use more than one context to achieve something, for example communicating with Authentication, User data, and Image storage to get the information it needs. Free are perfectly suited for this task.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;interpreters-are-your-io-monad&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#interpreters-are-your-io-monad&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: interpreters-are-your-io-monad&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Interpreters are your IO Monad&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear somebody screaming due to this statement. Apologies! But, in a sense, your interpreters can be considered a black box that will have side effects inside, which you don&#x27;t care much about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Free programs define steps to be done against a certain API, but nothing else. They are pure, no side effects, nothing, just a list of steps. Only when interpreted is when they really do something useful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means all the side effects happen in your interpreter. And that is good. We want to isolate side-effects in our codebases, but when trying to do so we may end up with some cumbersome stuff:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your return type: Int.
This is your return type on microservices: IO (Logger (Either HttpError Int))&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, we want to push side effects to the boundaries, which means we get horrible return types piling Task on top of Writer on top of Xor on top of any other monad we found. Within the interpreter we don&#x27;t need that. We know things will happen there, we can be ok with logging and running an IO fest within that black box. Because it&#x27;s isolated, and won&#x27;t leak, and we run it at the end, anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we get a cleaner return type as a consequence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;interpreters-should-be-your-test-target&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#interpreters-should-be-your-test-target&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: interpreters-should-be-your-test-target&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Interpreters should be your test target&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the codebase you&#x27;ll see a blunder I realised too late. Initially I tried to test programs by using an accumulating interpreter that stored the calls to the api in a State monad, returning some default values. This allowed me to compare expected output of the program vs the real output.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accumulating interpreter can be good to see what happens with a program (print all the calls, to the bottom of the stack), but it&#x27;s not a great fit for testing due to hardcoded values. I experimented with another interpreter that allowed me to mock expected responses, so I could test most complex values, but this wasn&#x27;t ideal nor satisfactory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realised I was approaching it wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Free, what I&#x27;d usually do is test a method for expected outputs given certain input. And that&#x27;s what I tried to do here. But with Free your method is nothing. I mean, it&#x27;s a description, so the test will be fully tangled with the program you defined.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want to test is the interpreter, or its core. You want to make sure the output for a given DSL call is what you expect. In our scenario, &lt;code&gt;TradeApiTaskInterpreter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; uses a client to to http calls. The return types are enforced during compilation of the DSL (we know a call to &lt;code&gt;buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will return an object of a certain type), but we may want to guarantee we are passing values like &lt;code&gt;price&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;quantity&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; correctly, or that if the http client returns an error we are capturing it and returning the proper &lt;code&gt;Left&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we want to focus our test efforts, which incidentally reduces the surface of code to be tested a lot, arguably giving us much robust code. Of course, there will be methods that mix Free monads with logical statements (if x call this monad, otherwise the other) which you will want to test as usual. But for methods that only use Free, focus on testing the interpreters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;beware-the-layers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#beware-the-layers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: beware-the-layers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Beware the layers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked about it when discussing why I implemented the two DSL I chose, but it&#x27;s worth repeating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that your interpreter (as a natural transformation) has limitations. Start with the top level API and consider if you need a lower level DSL for your purposes. It may be, as in our case, that a single layer is good enough. It may as well be that you have a case that justifies building your Free on a lower layer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, stacking Free is not trivial and may cause pain. Thread carefully.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;they-are-not-easy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#they-are-not-easy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: they-are-not-easy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
They are not easy&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People talking about Free mention they are not easy and that new teams (or teams without much experience in functional programming) should not adopt them directly. I realised I didn&#x27;t fully understand the warning when I started using them for this library. They seem easy, they are misleadingly so. But you will find yourself scratching your head many, many times, due to subtleties that arise when using them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t underestimate them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;aims-achieved&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#aims-achieved&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: aims-achieved&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Aims achieved?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to make a confession: I&#x27;ve not completed StockFighter. I got sidetracked while experimenting with the API  using their test server, so I&#x27;ve only solved the first (and trivial) level. Someday I&#x27;ll finish it :) I failed that aim.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#x27;s been an enlightening experiment, which made me realise the limitations and strengths of Free. That said, it&#x27;s a first step on the path and most likely in a few months I&#x27;ll revisit this and realise I was wrong. But, hey, learning. Or something ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, Free Monad are useful, but they are no silver bullet. What a surprise, isn&#x27;t it? Like everything else in IT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My previous post on &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;understanding-free-monads&quot;&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; implemented a few DSL using Free Monads. The same day I published it I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ProjectSeptemberInc&#x2F;freek&quot;&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mandubian&quot;&gt;Pascal Voitot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. How does FreeK help you when building a Free Monad?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve updated my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;free-monad-sample&quot;&gt;code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Free Monad with a sample using FreeK. The sample contains my previous implementation which only used &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;tut&#x2F;freemonad.html&quot;&gt;Cats&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Free implementation, so you can compare both side by side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say upfront that FreeK removed a bit of &lt;em&gt;boilerplate&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and made the implementation slightly cleaner. I feel the main benefit of FreeK is not so much the Free Monad tooling (which, don&#x27;t misunderstand me, is good!) but it&#x27;s integration with monad transformers, as well as the way it manages what Pascal calls &lt;em&gt;monadic onions of result types&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementing-free-with-freek&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#implementing-free-with-freek&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: implementing-free-with-freek&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Implementing Free with FreeK&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is, as expected, to define our languages. I assume (from now onwards) that you have read &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;understanding-free-monads&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; so I won&#x27;t discuss details already tackled in there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With FreeK we define our language like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;object Orders {
  sealed trait DSL[A]
  final case class ListStocks() extends DSL[List[Symbol]]
  final case class Buy(stock: Symbol, amount: Int) extends DSL[Response]
  final case class Sell(stock: Symbol, amount: Int) extends DSL[Response]
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is no different as how we were doing it before; a trait with case classes. The convention of calling the trait &lt;code&gt;DSL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and embedding it in the object is one I&#x27;ll use from now on, but it&#x27;s not exclusive of &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, can be used without it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interpreter is defined as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;object OrderInterpreter extends (Orders.DSL ~&amp;gt; Id) {
  import Orders._

  def apply[A](a: Orders.DSL[A]) = a match {
    case ListStocks() =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;Getting list of stocks: FB, TWTR&amp;quot;)
      List(&amp;quot;FB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;TWTR&amp;quot;)
    case Buy(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;Buying $amount of $stock&amp;quot;)
      &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
    case Sell(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;Selling $amount of $stock&amp;quot;)
      &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
  }
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which, again, is an alternative to the way we were defining interpreters before. Not &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; exclusive, but nicer :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#x27;s define the rest of our languages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Log dsl
object Log {
  sealed trait DSL[A]
  final case class Info(msg: String) extends DSL[Unit]
  final case class Error(msg: String) extends DSL[Unit]
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Defining the interpreter for Log
object LogInterpreter extends (Log.DSL ~&amp;gt; Id) {
  import Log._

  def apply[A](a: Log.DSL[A]) = a match {
    case Info(msg) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;[Info] - $msg&amp;quot;)
    case Error(msg) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;[Error] - $msg&amp;quot;)
  }
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Audit dsl
object Audit {
  sealed trait DSL[A]
  final case class UserAction(user: UserId, action: String, values: List[Values]) extends DSL[Unit]
  final case class SystemAction(job: JobId, action: String, values: List[Values]) extends DSL[Unit]
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Audit interpreter
object AuditInterpreter extends (Audit.DSL ~&amp;gt; Id) {
  import Audit._

  def apply[A](a: Audit.DSL[A]) = a match {
    case UserAction(user, action, values) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;[USER Action] - user $user called $action with values $values&amp;quot;)
    case SystemAction(job, action, values) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;[SYSTEM Action] - $job called $action with values $values&amp;quot;)
  }
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Messaging dsl
object Messaging {
  sealed trait DSL[A]
  final case class Publish(channelId: ChannelId, source: SourceId, messageId: MessageId, message: String) extends DSL[Response]
  final case class Subscribe(channelId: ChannelId, filterBy: Condition) extends DSL[Payload]
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Messaging interpreter
object MessagingInterpreter extends (Messaging.DSL ~&amp;gt; Id) {
  import Messaging._

  def apply[A](a: Messaging.DSL[A]) = a match {
    case Publish(channelId, source, messageId, message) =&amp;gt;
      println(s&amp;quot;Publish [$channelId] From: [$source] Id: [$messageId] Payload: [$message]&amp;quot;)
      &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
    case Subscribe(channelId, filterBy) =&amp;gt;
      val payload = &amp;quot;Event fired&amp;quot;
      println(s&amp;quot;Received message from [$channelId] (filter: [$filterBy]): [$payload]&amp;quot;)
      List(payload)
  }
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, languages defined. Next, let&#x27;s define our &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; type (or &lt;em&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for multiple types)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-free-coproduct-type&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-free-coproduct-type&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-free-coproduct-type&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The Free&#x2F;Coproduct type&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here is where &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; provides the first big improvement. &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; contains a specialised implementation of Shapeless &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for higher-kinded structures. The result is that we can define a type that includes several languages in one go, instead of having to create the chain of &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; we built in the previous post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; you use the same syntax for a Free that includes one or several languages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;type PRGOne[A] = (Log.DSL :|: FXNil)#Cop[A]
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; PRG is the one we will use in our code
type PRG[A] = (Log.DSL :|: Audit.DSL :|: Orders.DSL :|: FXNil)#Cop[A]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpreters get a similar benefit. You can leverage &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; specific syntax to easily compose interpreters from multiple languages. The only restrictions are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the interpreters must all be transformations to the same Monad (as with any composition of Natural Transformations, nothing new here)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they must be declared in the same order the types are defined in our &lt;code&gt;PRG&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; declaration.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;val interpreter: Interpreter[PRG, Id] = LogInterpreter :|: AuditInterpreter :|: OrderInterpreter
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this we have our &lt;em&gt;free type&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;interpreter&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. That was easy! We just need the program to execute, and we are done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-program&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-program&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-program&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The program&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have noticed, in the previous post we created some kind of support methods that lifted our case classes to a Free Monad. But this time we have not built anything similar. So, how are we going to use our case classes in a for-comprehension?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is given by *FreeK and a support method appropriately called &lt;code&gt;freek[A]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Let&#x27;s see an example of its usage by replicating the logic in our original program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;val program: Free[PRG, Response] = for {
      _ &amp;lt;- Info(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade smartly&amp;quot;).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- UserAction(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;)).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- Buy(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, 200).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- Info(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade even more smartly&amp;quot;).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- UserAction(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;)).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- Buy(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;, 100).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- UserAction(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;)).freek[PRG]
      rsp &amp;lt;- Sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 300).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- SystemAction(&amp;quot;BACKOFFICE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tradesCheck&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lastTrades&amp;quot;)).freek[PRG]
      _ &amp;lt;- Error(&amp;quot;Wait, what?!&amp;quot;).freek[PRG]
    } yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we are using the case classes we defined with our languages, directly. The magic happens within the &lt;code&gt;freek[PRG]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; call, which lifts our case class to a Free Monad of the &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; defined by &lt;code&gt;PRG&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have replaced support methods using &lt;code&gt;Free.liftF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Inject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with this call, which some people may argue is not a huge benefit, code wise. Personally, I believe it&#x27;s a big win as we have less clutter around our languages, where now we just see case classes and interpreters, and all the extra syntax is located within the program itself. Also, adding new languages is much simpler. What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can execute this program to verify it works:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;println(s&amp;quot;Use interpreter on `program`: ${program.foldMap(interpreter.nat)}&amp;quot;)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, remember that program that was returning a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; inside the monad, and thus required the use of traverse? Yes, we can also implement it using &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;val programWithList: Free[PRG, Response] = for {
  st &amp;lt;- ListStocks().freek[PRG]
  _ &amp;lt;- st.traverseU(Buy(_, 100).freek[PRG])
  rsp &amp;lt;- Sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 100).freek[PRG]
} yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need the &lt;code&gt;traverseU&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; trick, but it works the same, as &lt;code&gt;freek[PRG]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; returns a monad an that fits the signature of &lt;code&gt;traverseU&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. So we can port our programs, we are not losing any core functionality by using &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Orders via Messages&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last use case explored in the previous post was to define &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as a set of &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; operations, by chaining natural transformations from &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, to &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Can we do this with &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? Let&#x27;s start by defining a new interpreter from &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;object OrdersToMessagesInterpreter extends (Orders.DSL ~&amp;gt; Messaging.DSL) {
  import Orders._
  import Messaging._

  def apply[A](a: Orders.DSL[A]) = a match {
    case ListStocks() =&amp;gt;
      Publish(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot;, UUID.randomUUID().toString, &amp;quot;Get Stocks List&amp;quot;)
      Subscribe(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;)
    case Buy(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
      Publish(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot;, UUID.randomUUID().toString, s&amp;quot;Buy $stock $amount&amp;quot;)
    case Sell(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
      Publish(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot;, UUID.randomUUID().toString, s&amp;quot;Sell $stock $amount&amp;quot;)
  }
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step, let&#x27;s integrate this interpreter into the interpreter chain we defined before. To do this, we need to replace &lt;code&gt;OrderInterpreter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; by a composition of the new interpreter (from &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) and the existing interpreter from &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;val interpreterWithMessaging: Interpreter[PRG, Id] =
  LogInterpreter :|: AuditInterpreter :|: (MessagingInterpreter compose OrdersToMessagesInterpreter)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then we run our program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;println(s&amp;quot;Use interpreter with Messaging on `program`: ${program.foldMap(interpreterWithMessaging.nat)}&amp;quot;)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works, so it seems we can do what we expected! Can&#x27;t we?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the astute reader (i.e.: one that has read up to this point... congratulations!) will notice that in our previous implementation we were using a for-comprehension in &lt;code&gt;OrdersToMessagesInterpreter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for the case of &lt;code&gt;ListStocks&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. As we are working with case classes directly, not with monads, we can&#x27;t build the for-comprehension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to work around it by creating some additional types to lift the classes via &lt;code&gt;freek[A]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, so we can have the same code as before, but it&#x27;s become a bit verbose which means that, most likely, I&#x27;m doing something wrong :) Just be aware this use case may require a bit more effort than the others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#in-summary&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: in-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
In summary&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;em&gt;FreeK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, as it simplifies working with Free Monads. There may be a couple of scenarios which need either more work or a better understanding of the library, but in general it seems like a robust solutions. Let&#x27;s not forget it also provides utilities to mix monad transformers with our Free monads, which will solve several pains related to monad stacks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to use Free monads in our code, please give &lt;em&gt;Freek&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a go :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;freemonad.html&quot;&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is becoming popular, or at least I&#x27;ve seen plenty of mentions about it in the Scala Functional Programming community as of late. Why is it relevant?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of warnings before I start. Judging by the code I wrote, this will be a &lt;em&gt;very long&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; post. You can look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;free-monad-sample&quot;&gt;code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and come back to read this post later. Also, I&#x27;m going to take a &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; approach to Free Monad. I&#x27;ll provide a list of relevant links at the end you can use to learn more about Free Monad and its nuisances, including Cat&#x27;s explanation on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;freemonad.html#what-is-free-in-theory&quot;&gt;the theory behind Free&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. But no theory here, sorry :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s do this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-i-care-about-free-monad&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-i-care-about-free-monad&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-i-care-about-free-monad&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Why should I care about Free Monad?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything related to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;typeclasses&#x2F;monad.html&quot;&gt;Monads&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; seems scary and complex for the uninitiated. Why should I spend time learning that? What&#x27;s the benefit?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are descriptions of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;freemonad.html&quot;&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that give a good overview on why to use it. In my humble opinion, the main benefit that Free provides is separation between the program definition and its execution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start by building an embedded DSL, which can be understood by the business. Using that language, you define a program as a series of actions that cover a business case, without any implementation details associated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you can test the business-defined logic in isolation (with fast unit tests, no need of mocks). You can &lt;em&gt;talk the same language&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as the business. And only at the end, when needed, you provide a &lt;em&gt;real-world&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; implementation that interacts with 3rd party services and such.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the potential to provide more robust code, that can be tested easily, and which is a better fit to the business requirements. Also, replacing implementations (say, you change your sms provider) has minimal impact in the codebase as you only modify the interpreter, nothing else. Wether you do &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Domain-driven_design&quot;&gt;DDD&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or not, all this must sound &lt;em&gt;very appealing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, implementations of Free Monad (both in Cats and Scalaz) provide other benefits, for example the use of Trampolining for stack-safe recursion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit like with &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;typeclasses&#x2F;monad.html&quot;&gt;Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;freemonad.html&quot;&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a relatively simple concept behind a scary name. Easier than it seems, and very useful. Either that, or I&#x27;ve understood nothing and need to go back to the study desk ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-business-case&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#a-business-case&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-business-case&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
A business case&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll start with a very simplistic business case. We want to implement an application to buy and sell stocks. Our standard approach may generate code similar to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;object Orders {
	type Symbol = String
	type Response = String
	def buy(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): Response = ???
	def sell(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): Response = ???
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have heard about this new thing called &lt;code&gt;Free Monad&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and we want to use it. We start by creating a DSL, a business language, that describes our actions. For example, we convert&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  def buy(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): Response
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  case class Buy(stock: Symbol, amount: Int) extends Orders[Response]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see there is an equivalence in meaning between the two forms: case class parameters and method parameters, return value and type parameter in our case class (specifically in &lt;code&gt;Orders[Response]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;). We are converting our methods into a language, but one that has no implementation associated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do this with both methods, we get:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  sealed trait Orders[A]
  case class Buy(stock: Symbol, amount: Int) extends Orders[Response]
  case class Sell(stock: Symbol, amount: Int) extends Orders[Response]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a moment to see and understand the parallelisms between the above implementation, using case classes, and our original methods. Note that the parent trait &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is similar to a &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (a structure with a hole); this is a requirement of &lt;code&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, all the languages you define &lt;em&gt;must&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; follow a similar structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we have at this point? We have a language that defines buying or selling a stock. But it has no logic associated, and creating an instance does nothing (besides instantiating the case class). Furthermore, we can&#x27;t try to compile something like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  for {
	r &amp;lt;- Buy(&amp;quot;FB&amp;quot;, 100)
  } yield r
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it won&#x27;t work. We need to turn this into a Monad, somehow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lifting-to-free&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#lifting-to-free&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: lifting-to-free&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Lifting to Free&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use the language in our programs, we want to convert it into something we can run. For example, a Monad. That&#x27;s the task of a Free Monad, and Cats provides a very easy way to do that:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  import cats.free.Free

  type OrdersF[A] = Free[Orders, A]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have defined a new type, a &lt;code&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; Monad on &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and a parameter &lt;code&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. But that&#x27;s not enough, we need to map our case classes to instances of &lt;code&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Thankfully &lt;code&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; itself makes this step easy:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  import cats.free.Free._

  def buy(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): OrdersF[Response] = liftF[Orders, Response](Buy(stock, amount))
  def sell(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): OrdersF[Response] = liftF[Orders, Response](Sell(stock, amount))
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the return types of the methods, &lt;code&gt;OrdersF[Response]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, match the Free Monad (as defined above). Also, the type parameter returned, &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, matches the parameter in the &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; portion of our case class definition, which we mapped to work akin to &lt;em&gt;return type&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; when converting from methods to case classes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can use these support methods, &lt;code&gt;buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sell&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, to obtain our monads. And it works:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;  val flatMapThat = buy(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, 100).flatMap(rsp =&amp;gt; sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 100))
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code above builds and returns a &lt;code&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; structure. This means that we can use the monads to define some business logic. For example, we can define a smart algorithm to buy and sell shares:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;val smartTrade: OrdersF[Response] = for {
    _ &amp;lt;- buy(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, 50)
    _ &amp;lt;- buy(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;, 10)
    rsp &amp;lt;- sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 200)
  } yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using a for-comprehension to chain a series of actions. &lt;code&gt;buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sell&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are used to obtain the monads that define the steps of the algorithm. As you can see, the return type is &lt;code&gt;OrdersF[Response]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as expected by the logic, which yields the result of calling &lt;code&gt;sell&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we have built a language for our business case, along algorithms that use that language. But this code still does nothing else than defining the steps, we have no way to obtain a result from it. We need a way to execute, or interpret, our language.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-first-interpreter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#our-first-interpreter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: our-first-interpreter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Our first interpreter&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interpreter is something that will read our program and do something with it. Technically, an interpreter is a &lt;code&gt;natural transformation&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, but as I said at the start I don&#x27;t want to focus on the theory right now. The key thing to know is that an interpreter requires a monad as the end-part of the transformation. This means you can use an interpreter to obtain &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, or some other monad, but not to obtain anything that is not a monad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual an example is better than a thousand words, so let&#x27;s use the simplest monad, &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, to build an interpreter:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import cats.{Id, ~&amp;gt;}

def orderPrinter: Orders ~&amp;gt; Id =
    new (Orders ~&amp;gt; Id) {
      def apply[A](fa: Orders[A]): Id[A] = fa match {
        case Buy(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
          println(s&amp;quot;Buying $amount of $stock&amp;quot;)
          &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
        case Sell(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
          println(s&amp;quot;Selling $amount of $stock&amp;quot;)
          &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
      }
    }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This squiggly sign &lt;code&gt;~&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the syntax sugar for &lt;code&gt;natural transformation&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Note that in the interpreter we do a pattern match over each member of our language. As &lt;code&gt;Buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;Order[Response]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (equivalent to &lt;code&gt;Order[String]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in this scenario), the method signature forces us to return a result of &lt;code&gt;Id[String]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The same for &lt;code&gt;Sell&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we are also executing some &lt;code&gt;println&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; statements before returning the result. The only restriction given by the signature is the return type, we can have side effects in our code (as we do in this case). Obviously this is not advisable, but it can be useful when we create interpreters for testing purposes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have our interpreter, which means that we have all the pieces we need to execute the program. We can do this via the &lt;code&gt;foldMap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; operation:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt; smartTrade.foldMap(orderPrinter)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we will see the result of the &lt;code&gt;println&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; operations in our terminal:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Buying 50 of APPL
Buying 10 of MSFT
Selling 200 of GOOG
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s working! We have built our first Free Monad, and it works. Take your time to understand what we have done, and remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;free-monad-sample&quot;&gt;code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is available to download.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;xor-interpreters&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#xor-interpreters&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: xor-interpreters&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Xor Interpreters&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built our first interpreter, but let&#x27;s be honest: &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is not so useful, and we want to avoid side-effects in our code. If we aim to do something akin to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsharpforfunandprofit.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;recipe-part2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;railway oriented programming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; we may want to use &lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this reveals a slight issue: the natural transformation expects a monad with shape &lt;code&gt;G[_]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Xor[+A, +B]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. There is a mismatch in the number of &lt;em&gt;holes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Thankfully we can fix that with a small trick, by fixing the type of the left side of &lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;type ErrorOr[A] = Xor[String, A]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a new monadic type with a single type parameter, which fits the requirements of natural transformation. You may want to use an ADT instead of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on the left side, to make it more flexible. In any case, we can now construct a new interpreter:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import cats.syntax.xor._
import cats.data.Xor

def xorInterpreter: Orders ~&amp;gt; ErrorOr =
 new (Orders ~&amp;gt; ErrorOr) {
   def apply[A](fa: Orders[A]): ErrorOr[A] =
     fa match {
       case Buy(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
         s&amp;quot;$stock - $amount&amp;quot;.right
       case Sell(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
         &amp;quot;Why are you selling that?&amp;quot;.left
     }
 }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and if we execute it&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt; smartTrade.foldMap(xorInterpreter)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we will see that the result is a left:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Left(Why are you selling that?)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a very important point: you are using your interpreter in a for-comprehension (usually). If you return a monadic value that would usually shortcut the process, like &lt;code&gt;Xor.Left&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;None&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, the remainder of the program won&#x27;t we executed.
This may be what you want, but be aware of this behaviour. For a relevant example, if we had a case class extending &lt;code&gt;Orders[Unit]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and a natural transformation to &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we may want to return &lt;code&gt;Some(())&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;None&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to avoid this behaviour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we have built another interpreter, and it works. But our language is still very simple, let&#x27;s make it a bit more useful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;extending-the-language&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#extending-the-language&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: extending-the-language&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Extending the language&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want smart algorithms, and hardcoding the stocks to buy won&#x27;t help. We are aiming to build programs similar to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt; val smartTradeWithList: Free[Orders, String] = for {
    st &amp;lt;- listStocks()
    _ &amp;lt;- buy(st, 100)
    rsp &amp;lt;- sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 100)
  } yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can start by defining a new case class and lifting it to a Free Monad instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;case class ListStocks() extends Orders[List[Symbol]]

def listStocks(): OrdersF[List[Symbol]] =
  liftF[Orders, List[Symbol]](ListStocks())
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you execute the program above (&lt;code&gt;smartTradeWithList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) you will see it doesn&#x27;t compile. The reason is that &lt;code&gt;buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; expects a single &lt;code&gt;Symbol&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;st&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;List[Symbol]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Ah, but of course! We are flatmapping over &lt;code&gt;OrdersF[A]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and, as expected, the left side of the for-comprehension binds to the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; value. In our case, as &lt;code&gt;listStocks&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;OrdersF[List[Symbol]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;st&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;List[Symbol]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what now? If we couldn&#x27;t work around this restriction, the utility of Free Monads would be very limited, as this is a common use case. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eed3si9n.com&#x2F;herding-cats&#x2F;Traverse.html&quot;&gt;Traverse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; typeclass solves exactly this kind of issue. We can rewrite our program as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import cats.std.list._
import cats.syntax.traverse._

val smartTradeWithList: Free[Orders, String] = for {
    st &amp;lt;- listStocks()
    _ &amp;lt;- st.traverseU(buy(_, 100))
    rsp &amp;lt;- sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 100)
  } yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, with slightly more verbose code, it will compile. We could always hide the extra verbosity behind a helper method, if we want. We must also update our &lt;code&gt;orderPrinter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to tackle the new &lt;code&gt;ListStocks&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; case:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt; def orderPrinter: Orders ~&amp;gt; Id =
    new (Orders ~&amp;gt; Id) {
      def apply[A](fa: Orders[A]): Id[A] =
	  fa match {
        case ListStocks() =&amp;gt;
          println(s&amp;quot;Getting list of stocks: FB, TWTR&amp;quot;)
          List(&amp;quot;FB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;TWTR&amp;quot;)
        case Buy(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
          println(s&amp;quot;Buying $amount of $stock&amp;quot;)
          &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
        case Sell(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
          println(s&amp;quot;Selling $amount of $stock&amp;quot;)
          &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
      }
    }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we can execute the new program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;smartTradeWithList.foldMap(orderPrinter)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to see the expected output:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Getting list of stocks: FB, TWTR
Buying 100 of FB
Buying 100 of TWTR
Selling 100 of GOOG
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language works. We can now build our smart programs and release into production to, hopefully, earn us a lot of money. Well, almost. The programs work, but if someone makes a mistake, how will we know? We might want to add some logging, but we don&#x27;t want to use side effects. How to do it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-logs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#adding-logs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: adding-logs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Adding Logs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging is a language in itself. We want to embed log messages in the application, but how to manage them is another matter: we may want to ignore them on testing, to send them to a log file, or even to several destination. As such, using a Free Monad for logs makes sense. So let&#x27;s define the language and create the associated Free Monad:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;sealed trait Log[A]

case class Info(msg: String) extends Log[Unit]

case class Error(msg: String) extends Log[Unit]

type LogF[A] = Free[Log, A]

def info(msg: String): LogF[Unit] =
  liftF[Log, Unit](Info(msg))

def error(msg: String): LogF[Unit] =
  liftF[Log, Unit](Error(msg))

def logPrinter: Log ~&amp;gt; Id =
  new (Log ~&amp;gt; Id) {
    def apply[A](fa: Log[A]): Id[A] =
	  fa match {
        case Info(msg) =&amp;gt;
		  println(s&amp;quot;[Info] - $msg&amp;quot;)
        case Error(msg) =&amp;gt;
		  println(s&amp;quot;[Error] - $msg&amp;quot;)
      }
  }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen this before, nothing new here. We can now log &lt;code&gt;info&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;error&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; messages and we have an interpreter to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that will send some output to the terminal. Let&#x27;s add some logging to our program, then:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;val smartTradeWithLogs = for {
    _ &amp;lt;- info(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade smartly&amp;quot;)
    _ &amp;lt;- buy(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, 100)
    _ &amp;lt;- info(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade even more smartly&amp;quot;)
    _ &amp;lt;- buy(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;, 100)
    rsp &amp;lt;- sell(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 100)
    _ &amp;lt;- error(&amp;quot;Wait, what?!&amp;quot;)
  } yield rsp
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, no, this doesn&#x27;t compile. The reason is clear once you look at the signature of &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flatMap[A,B](a: F[A])(f: A =&amp;gt; F[B]): F[B]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The initial and final monad must be the same when using &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, but in here we are mixing &lt;code&gt;OrdersF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LogF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; monads in the same for-comprehension. So it won&#x27;t compile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, in Cats, is to use an alternative way to lift our case classes to Monads. Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;liftF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method from &lt;code&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; we will use a slightly more complex structure that will help us later to mix both Monads. Let&#x27;s start with an example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import cats.free.{Free, Inject}

class OrderI[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Orders, F]) {
  def buyI(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): Free[F, Response] = Free.inject[Orders, F](Buy(stock, amount))

  def sellI(stock: Symbol, amount: Int): Free[F, Response] = Free.inject[Orders, F](Sell(stock, amount))
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; We need this implicit
implicit def orderI[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Orders, F]): OrderI[F] = new OrderI[F]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we create a class &lt;code&gt;OrderI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that contains two methods which will lift our case classes into monads, by using &lt;code&gt;Free.inject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The key part here is the implicit &lt;code&gt;Inject[Orders, F]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which, on compilation, will resolve to a type that binds everything together. The implicit method &lt;code&gt;orderI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is there to facilitate using this construct in our program, as we will see later on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this as a template to follow, a bit of boilerplate to lift case classes into monads, no need to understand all the details right now. Note that we can use both &lt;code&gt;liftF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and this &lt;em&gt;new&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; way to lift our case classes into monads, they are not exclusive nor incompatible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s do the same for our new language &lt;code&gt;Log&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import cats.free.{Free, Inject}

class LogI[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Log, F]) {
  def infoI(msg: String): Free[F, Unit] =
    Free.inject[Log, F](Info(msg))

  def errorI(msg: String): Free[F, Unit] =
    Free.inject[Log, F](Error(msg))
}

implicit def logI[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Log, F]): LogI[F] = new LogI[F]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a way to lift both languages into monads, we need a way to use both in a for-comprehension. The solution here is given by &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (explanation on this typeclass outside of the scope, sorry!) which will allow us to wire both types together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;import cats.data.Coproduct

type TradeApp[A] = Coproduct[Orders, Log, A]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this we can now define our program, again:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def smartTradeWithLogs(implicit O: OrderI[TradeApp],
                                L: LogI[TradeApp]): Free[TradeApp, Response] = {
  import L._
  import O._

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Look, ma, both monads at once!
  for {
    _ &amp;lt;- infoI(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade smartly&amp;quot;)
    _ &amp;lt;- buyI(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, 100)
    _ &amp;lt;- infoI(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade even more smartly&amp;quot;)
    _ &amp;lt;- buyI(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;, 100)
    rsp &amp;lt;- sellI(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 100)
    _ &amp;lt;- errorI(&amp;quot;Wait, what?!&amp;quot;)
  } yield rsp
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compiles. We are using the implicit methods defined before to create instances of &lt;code&gt;OrderI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LogI&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. By receiving our &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as the type parameter, their implicit &lt;code&gt;Inject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will help us build a compatibility layer between both monads. You can check the source code of &lt;code&gt;Inject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to understand how this works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have our program, with both behaviour and logs in it. Now we want to execute it. Unfortunately, the interpreters we defined before can&#x27;t be used as they are, we need an interpreter for the new &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; type. The good news are that this new interpreter can be built on top of the existing ones:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def composedInterpreter: TradeApp ~&amp;gt; Id = orderPrinter or logPrinter
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interpreter is defining a natural transformation from &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (a monad) to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (another monad). As &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and we already have interpreters from each of its elements to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we can take advantage of the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method in a natural transformation and delegate the task to our existing interpreters. Reuse is always good :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can run this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;smartTradeWithLogs.foldMap(composedInterpreter)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we will see the output in our terminal, including the logs:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Info] - I&amp;#x27;m going to trade smartly
Buying 100 of APPL
[Info] - I&amp;#x27;m going to trade even more smartly
Buying 100 of MSFT
Selling 100 of GOOG
[Error] - Wait, what?!
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. Two full languages working together to define a program, that we can later on run with a specific interpreter. Isn&#x27;t it neat? Although the code seems more verbose that with the original example, remember that we are defining all these elements (implicit classes and interpreters) just once, and they will work with all our programs using these languages. Not a bad trade-off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-better-than-2-languages&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#what-s-better-than-2-languages&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-s-better-than-2-languages&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
What&#x27;s better than 2 languages?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can build programs with two languages, but... what if we want three? We are managing money and shares, so besides logs we may be required to add auditing to the application. How easy is that? Let&#x27;s start by defining a third language, &lt;code&gt;Audit&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, as we just did with the other two:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;sealed trait Audit[A]

case class UserActionAudit(user: UserId, action: String, values: List[Values]) extends Audit[Unit]

case class SystemActionAudit(job: JobId, action: String, values: List[Values]) extends Audit[Unit]

class AuditI[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Audit, F]) {
  def userAction(user: UserId, action: String, values: List[Values]): Free[F, Unit] =
    Free.inject[Audit, F](UserActionAudit(user, action, values))

  def systemAction(job: JobId, action: String, values: List[Values]): Free[F, Unit] =
    Free.inject[Audit, F](SystemActionAudit(job, action, values))
}

implicit def auditI[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Audit, F]): AuditI[F] = new AuditI[F]

def auditPrinter: Audit ~&amp;gt; Id =
  new (Audit ~&amp;gt; Id) {
    def apply[A](fa: Audit[A]): Id[A] =
	  fa match {
        case UserActionAudit(user, action, values) =&amp;gt;
		  println(s&amp;quot;[USER Action] - user $user called $action with values $values&amp;quot;)
        case SystemActionAudit(job, action, values) =&amp;gt;
		  println(s&amp;quot;[SYSTEM Action] - $job called $action with values $values&amp;quot;)
      }
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, you have seen all this before. We have a language, we lift the case classes to Free Monad and we create an interpreter to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Easy. The complex part comes when we want to define our &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and the typeclass is declared as &lt;code&gt;Coproduct[F[_], G[_], A]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which means we have room for only two monads, &lt;code&gt;F&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;G&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. But we need 3. Ouch!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, wait! In the previous section we defined the &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; coproduct. Which is a coproduct, yes, but also behaves like our Free Monads, so we can consider it a Monad (I&#x27;m not sure if it is technically correct to call it a Monad, but let&#x27;s ignore that by now). This means, in fact, we have only two monads: &lt;code&gt;Audit&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. So we can build the &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;type AuditableTradeApp[A] = Coproduct[Audit, TradeApp, A]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note of interest: due to the way &lt;code&gt;Inject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is implemented, our &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class needs to be on the right hand side, otherwise this code won&#x27;t compile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the type, what about the interpreter? Yes, we can reuse our existing ones, this has not changed:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def auditableInterpreter: AuditableTradeApp ~&amp;gt; Id = auditPrinter or composedInterpreter
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that in the interpreter the order also matters, due to the implementation details of &lt;code&gt;or&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. But, at this point, we have all the pieces we need and we can build our program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def smartTradeWithAuditsAndLogs(implicit O: OrderI[AuditableTradeApp],
                                         L: LogI[AuditableTradeApp],
										 A: AuditI[AuditableTradeApp]
							    ): Free[AuditableTradeApp, Response] = {
  import A._
  import L._
  import O._

  for {
    _ &amp;lt;- infoI(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade smartly&amp;quot;)
    _ &amp;lt;- userAction(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;))
    _ &amp;lt;- buyI(&amp;quot;APPL&amp;quot;, 200)
    _ &amp;lt;- infoI(&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m going to trade even more smartly&amp;quot;)

    _ &amp;lt;- buyI(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;, 100)
    _ &amp;lt;- userAction(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;))
    rsp &amp;lt;- sellI(&amp;quot;GOOG&amp;quot;, 300)
    _ &amp;lt;- systemAction(&amp;quot;BACKOFFICE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tradesCheck&amp;quot;, List(&amp;quot;ID102&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lastTrades&amp;quot;))
    _ &amp;lt;- errorI(&amp;quot;Wait, what?!&amp;quot;)
  } yield rsp
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and on execution&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;smartTradeWithAuditsAndLogs.foldMap(auditableInterpreter)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it. We have three languages working together in our program. And the only additional definitions are a couple of &lt;code&gt;Coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; types as well as interpreters, which are built reusing existing interpreters for our types. Not a lot of work for the benefits we get, if I can say so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage we could try to add more languages, but we see the pattern on how it would work. So let&#x27;s try something different.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-monads-all-the-way-down&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#free-monads-all-the-way-down&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: free-monads-all-the-way-down&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Free Monads all the way down&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; language didn&#x27;t specify how would we send an order to someone. We could code that into an interpreter, true. But we can safely assume that Orders will be propagated via either HTTP requests or Messages to some system. Given the recent popularity of event-sourcing and Kafka, let&#x27;s say some publish-subscribe system. It would be wasteful to redefine the details to interact with that system in each interpreter that needed so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can think that a language exists to interact with that system, so we should be able to define a Free Monad to work with that language. Let&#x27;s do so:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;sealed trait Messaging[A]
case class Publish(channelId: ChannelId, source: SourceId, messageId: MessageId, payload: Payload) extends Messaging[Response]
case class Subscribe(channelId: ChannelId, filterBy: Condition) extends Messaging[Payload]

type MessagingF[A] = Free[Messaging, A]

def publish(channelId: ChannelId, source: SourceId, messageId: MessageId, payload: Payload): MessagingF[Response] =
  liftF[Messaging, Response](Publish(channelId, source, messageId, payload))

def subscribe(channelId: ChannelId, filterBy: Condition): MessagingF[Payload] =
  liftF[Messaging, Payload](Subscribe(channelId, filterBy))

def messagingPrinter: Messaging ~&amp;gt; Id =
  new (Messaging ~&amp;gt; Id) {
    def apply[A](fa: Messaging[A]): Id[A] =
	  fa match {
        case Publish(channelId, source, messageId, payload) =&amp;gt;
          println(s&amp;quot;Publish [$channelId] From: [$source] Id: [$messageId] Payload: [$payload]&amp;quot;)
          &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;
        case Subscribe(channelId, filterBy) =&amp;gt;
          val payload = &amp;quot;Event fired&amp;quot;
          println(s&amp;quot;Received message from [$channelId](filter: [$filterBy]): [$payload]&amp;quot;)
          payload
      }
   }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing new here either, we defined another language, this time using &lt;code&gt;liftF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, along an interpreter to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to print messages to the terminal. By now, you should be able to do this with your eyes closed ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the language. How to make &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; work with this language, such that we can define our orders in terms of operations against a publish-subscribe network? The answer is natural transformation. If you remember, a natural transformation allows us to convert our original language to a new monad. And &lt;code&gt;MessagingF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a monad, a free one. Which means we can do the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def orderToMessageInterpreter: Orders ~&amp;gt; MessagingF =
  new (Orders ~&amp;gt; MessagingF) {
    def apply[A](fa: Orders[A]): MessagingF[A] = {
      fa match {
        case ListStocks() =&amp;gt;
          for {
            _ &amp;lt;- publish(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot;, UUID.randomUUID().toString, &amp;quot;Get Stocks List&amp;quot;)
            payload &amp;lt;- subscribe(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;)
          } yield List(payload)
        case Buy(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
          publish(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot;, UUID.randomUUID().toString, s&amp;quot;Buy $stock $amount&amp;quot;)
        case Sell(stock, amount) =&amp;gt;
          publish(&amp;quot;001&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orders&amp;quot;, UUID.randomUUID().toString, s&amp;quot;Sell $stock $amount&amp;quot;)
      }
    }
  }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compiles (and works, as we will see later). And yes, you can use a for-comprehension inside the interpreter, as we do in our &lt;code&gt;ListStocks&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; case. This specific transformation is simpler due to the fact that &lt;code&gt;publish&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;buy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sell&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; have the same response type &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, but as you can see adapting the results wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, if required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was easy, wasn&#x27;t it? So what about our interpreter? How do we bridge from &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; while using &lt;code&gt;MessagingF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;? For this case we need to build a small bridge between interpreters. Let me show you what I mean:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def messagingFreePrinter: MessagingF ~&amp;gt; Id =
  new (MessagingF ~&amp;gt; Id) {
    def apply[A](fa: MessagingF[A]): Id[A] =
	  fa.foldMap(messagingPrinter)
  }

def ordersToTerminalViaMessage: Orders ~&amp;gt; Id =
  orderToMessageInterpreter andThen messagingFreePrinter
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can chain natural transformations via their &lt;code&gt;andThen&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method. In this case, though, we have a small mismatch of parameters: &lt;code&gt;orderToMessageInterpreter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;MessagingF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; but &lt;code&gt;messagingPrinter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; expects &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The solution is to create a new interpreter from &lt;code&gt;MessagingF&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The good news is that this interpreter can reuse our existing &lt;code&gt;messagingPrinter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;foldMap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which means this bridge is not adding risk (as in new logic) to our application.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use all this together to run our original program, without logging nor auditing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;smartTrade.foldMap(ordersToTerminalViaMessage)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we see&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Publish [001] From: [Orders] Id: [c7f22b1e-b688-4f61-82cb-39b421b8ab6c] Payload: [Buy APPL 50]
Publish [001] From: [Orders] Id: [94bbf71d-1c95-4c26-97a3-ce0b970893aa] Payload: [Buy MSFT 10]
Publish [001] From: [Orders] Id: [27311809-97f9-4e04-b813-7a2cf9743415] Payload: [Sell GOOG 200]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we are running our orders via another Free Monad that represents a lower-level layer in the stack. This means we can compose this new monad with other languages, as needed. This has the benefit that improvements to the interpreters of this new &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; language will be automatically propagated to any program indirectly using it, as well as reducing the amount of code that needs to be tested thanks to reuse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one last task left: use this new &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; language with our program that has logs and audit commands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-together&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#all-together&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: all-together&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
All together&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to put all this together. We have a program, &lt;code&gt;smartTradeWithAuditsAndLogs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, that has logging and auditing. We want to run it against an interpreter that also uses our &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; interpreter defined above, &lt;code&gt;ordersToTerminalViaMessage&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we need to define two new interpreters. The reason is that our original &lt;code&gt;TradeApp ~&amp;gt; Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; interpreter wasn&#x27;t running through our &lt;code&gt;Messaging&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; language, and by changing the interpreter for &lt;code&gt;TradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; we will also need to define a new one for &lt;code&gt;AuditableTradeApp&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;def composedViaMessageInterpreter: TradeApp ~&amp;gt; Id =
  ordersToTerminalViaMessage or logPrinter

def auditableToTerminalViaMessage: AuditableTradeApp ~&amp;gt; Id =
  auditPrinter or composedViaMessageInterpreter
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, the good news is that we are reusing our previous original interpreters, just modifying how we combine them. When you think about it, we have only 4 interpreters to &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, one per language. All the other interpreters are combinations of these. Which means that, although it seems we are reimplementing them often, in fact we are not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this last interpreter we can run our full program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;smartTradeWithAuditsAndLogs.foldMap(auditableToTerminalViaMessage)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and see in our terminal&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Info] - I&amp;#x27;m going to trade smartly
[USER Action] - user ID102 called buy with values List(APPL, 100)

[SYSTEM Action] - BACKOFFICE called tradesCheck with values List(ID102, lastTrades)
[Error] - Wait, what?!
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s it. We have defined a program using 4 different languages, used at different levels of abstraction. Quite a comprehensive case, if the length of this post is any indication :) I hope this showcases the main uses of Free Monad and gives you a better understanding on the subject.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you can clone the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;free-monad-sample&quot;&gt;code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to play with all this yourself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#x27;s talk about a couple of issues with Free Monads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance-impact&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#performance-impact&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: performance-impact&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Performance impact&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we add an abstraction, performance may diminish. I&#x27;ve not done any tests on performance using Free Monads as doing a proper benchmark is very hard, but I found a couple of references on the subject which may help understanding the impact.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;okmij.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;Computation&#x2F;free-monad.html&quot;&gt;Free Monad explanation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is quite comprehensive, and it says about performance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we have to pay for all the benefits of free and freer monads in performance?
With the simplest free and freer monads described so far: yes, the performance suffers.
One should keep in mind that performance does not always matter: a large portion of software
we successfully interact with every day is written in Python, Perl or Ruby, and which are not
exactly speed kings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the statement above in that most of our applications are not performance sensitive, within certain limits. For most operations the overhead introduced by Free Monad is not relevant, but don&#x27;t use it if performance is critical to your business case.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mandubian&quot;&gt;Pascal Voitot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wrote last year a post on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mandubian.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;09&#x2F;freer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;better implementations&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Free. As far as I understand, some of the concepts are already implemented in Cats and may reduce the impact of Free a bit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, each use case is different. You should test your implementation to ensure resulting performance is acceptable to you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-criticisms&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-criticisms&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-criticisms&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The criticisms&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve left this part to the last, at the point where saw a full implementation of Free and we can judge the criticisms from a more informed perspective. Shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that not everybody likes Free Monad, and there are some justified criticisms to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, recently &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;alexelcu&quot;&gt;Alexandru Nedelcu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monix.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Monix&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; fame, tweeted a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;alexelcu&#x2F;status&#x2F;736090380999888898&quot;&gt;opinions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where he highlights some trade offs you make when you decide to use Free Monads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;event.scaladays.org&#x2F;scaladays-nyc-2016#!#schedulePopupExtras-7558&quot;&gt;talk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kelleyrobinson&quot;&gt;Kelley Robinson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gave a bit more detail on situations in which Free Monad may not be a good fit. The video has not been published yet, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;KelleyRobinson1&#x2F;why-the-free-monad-isnt-free-61836547&quot;&gt;slides&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; available.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I&#x27;ve lost a couple of references I had with people raising concerns about Free Monad. But I hope these two give you an idea of the general issues people have with this pattern.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, you have to remember the Free Monad is just a tool, and no tool is a silver bullet. It may be a perfect fit for your application and team, right now, but you should understand the trade offs you are accepting. Unfortunately you can only understand that through experience; my advice is to start using it in areas of the code where the impact will be small and spread it as you learn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Thanks&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With concepts like Free Monad, existing literature and people&#x27;s help are crucial to navigate the hard parts. It would be unfair to not mention all contributions that helped me to understand (or so I hope) Free Monad, and to write this post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s plenty of information online that has been extremely useful. The most relevant links are listed in the next section. A big thanks to all the authors, the time spent on that documentation has helped at least one person :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;milessabin&quot;&gt;Miles Sabin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;channingwalton&quot;&gt;Channing Walton&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lancewalton&quot;&gt;Lance Walton&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as experimentation we did with Free Monad provided a foundation for this post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;julientruffaut&quot;&gt;Julien Truffaut&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He pointed to &lt;code&gt;traversableU&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as the solution to mixing &lt;code&gt;List&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; results in the program for &lt;code&gt;Orders&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. I got stuck in that case and, without his contribution, I&#x27;d be giving a horribly wrong solution to you, my reader.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, I need to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;typelevel&#x2F;cats&quot;&gt;Cat&#x27;s Gitter channel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;adelbertchang&quot;&gt;Adelbert Chang&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as he corrected a few misconceptions I had whilst porting a Free Monad built using Scalaz to a version using Cats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/monkey-island-battles-and-webkit/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;welcome.html&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Do you like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monkey_Island_(series)&quot;&gt;Monkey Island&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Are you into &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;monkeyisland.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Insult_Sword_Fighting&quot;&gt;Insult Sword Fighting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Then, come along, this may interest you ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;backstory&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#backstory&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: backstory&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Backstory&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;welcome.html&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a while. To be honest I&#x27;ve not yet done so due to laziness: my experience with AWS is that it needs more configuration and tweaking than I care for. Give me a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heroku.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; any day (pros and cons, lengthy discussion for another day).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But going through my &#x27;list of stuff you should read&#x27; I recently saw an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;underscore.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;aws-lambda.html&quot;&gt;Underscore blog-post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;d6y&quot;&gt;Richard Dallaway&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. AWS again, maybe it&#x27;s time to do something that uses it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got me started: sure there must be alternatives, something akin to &quot;Heroku for Lambdas&quot;? Yes, I&#x27;m aware AWS Lambdas are simple to use, but well, procrastination... So I started looking for options and I landed on a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Are-there-any-alternatives-to-Amazon-Lambda&quot;&gt;Quora question&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webtask.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebTask.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-webtask&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#using-webtask&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: using-webtask&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Using WebTask&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webtask.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebTask.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; sounds exactly like what I was looking for. And, oh boy, it is simple to use!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed their instructions to install their &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webtask.io&#x2F;cli&quot;&gt;cli&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which gives you a very intuitive command &lt;code&gt;wt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with options you&#x27;d expect (create, rm, ls). In just a few minutes I had my own endpoint running. Neat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I needed something to test this a bit more. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monkey_Island_(series)&quot;&gt;Monkey Island&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. If you have played those games you most likely remember their &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;monkeyisland.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Insult_Sword_Fighting&quot;&gt;Insult Sword Fighting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; scenes. Even if you didn&#x27;t play it you may know what they are, due to popularity in certain circles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing a service that given a specific insult returns the correct answer seemed like a very straightforward task that would let me test the service and find any obvious hurdles. So that&#x27;s what I built; you can get the code in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;webtask-monkey-island&quot;&gt;my github repo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service has a very basic behaviour:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you just call the endpoint (GET request), returns a random pair of insult-answer (in Json)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you call the endpoint with an &lt;code&gt;insult&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; parameter it will return the correct response for that insult&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you call the endpoint with an invalid&#x2F;unknown &lt;code&gt;insult&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; the response will notify you so&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction is all via &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; requests, and it returns &lt;code&gt;Json&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (no &lt;code&gt;404&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; codes for invalid insults). As I said, a very basic implementation to test how hard is to use that service (note: not hard at all). Webkit  provides the tools to implement all this properly, it&#x27;s just I didn&#x27;t use them ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-the-service&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#testing-the-service&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: testing-the-service&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Testing the service&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published a Webtask endpoint at:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;webtask.it.auth0.com&amp;#x2F;api&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;wt-pere_villega-gmail_com-0&amp;#x2F;sword-fight?webtask_no_cache=1 .
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware it is under a free plan, so it may be rate limited and disappear in 30 days. If you want to try it yourself, remember the sample code is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;webtask-monkey-island&quot;&gt;my github repo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s see how it works. If we run the request without any additional parameter, we should obtain a random pair of insult-response.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ curl https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;webtask.it.auth0.com&amp;#x2F;api&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;wt-pere_villega-gmail_com-0&amp;#x2F;sword-fight\?webtask_no_cache\=1
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;returns:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;{
	&amp;quot;received&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Nobody&amp;#x27;s ever drawn blood from me and nobody ever will.&amp;quot;,
	&amp;quot;answer&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You run THAT fast?&amp;quot;
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can provide a parameter with our &lt;em&gt;insult&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to receive the right response:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ curl  https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;webtask.it.auth0.com&amp;#x2F;api&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;wt-pere_villega-gmail_com-0&amp;#x2F;sword-fight?webtask_no_cache=1&amp;amp;insult=You%27re%20the%20ugliest%20monster%20ever%20created!
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which, as expected, returns:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;{
	&amp;quot;received&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re the ugliest monster ever created!&amp;quot;,
	&amp;quot;answer&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;If you don&amp;#x27;t count all the ones you&amp;#x27;ve dated.&amp;quot;
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we provide an insult that is not recognised, like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ curl  https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;webtask.it.auth0.com&amp;#x2F;api&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;wt-pere_villega-gmail_com-0&amp;#x2F;sword-fight?webtask_no_cache=1&amp;amp;insult=baka!
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the lambda complains:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;{
	&amp;quot;received&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;baka!&amp;quot;,
	&amp;quot;answer&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Incorrect insult!&amp;quot;
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working as expected!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-work&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#future-work&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: future-work&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Future Work&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I just wanted to dabble with this so I didn&#x27;t put much more effort into it. An obvious improvement is to allow the user to &lt;em&gt;fight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; against the machine, although this would require preserving some state in the server-side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately WebTask provides limited support for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webtask.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;storage&quot;&gt;storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which could be used to manage score for a given user, storing all the information in a map. But there&#x27;ll be concurrency issues with very low loads, so it may not be such a good idea after all. Something stateless like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;left-pad.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;left-pad.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; fits the lambda model better ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, WebTask mentions in their documentation how their service can be used to enhance the security of your application by hiding api keys and other sensitive resources inside lambdas. It&#x27;s an interesting concept worth a bit of research, as it may be a good pattern to adapt in your standard deployment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, that&#x27;s all for now. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skillsmatter.com&#x2F;conferences&#x2F;6862-scala-exchange-2015#program&quot;&gt;Scala Exchange 2015&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is on!

Keynote: Spark+Hadoop and how it relates to Scala&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sean_r_owen&quot;&gt;Sean Owen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intends to give a different perspective on Scala, a less technical talk, more about his path into Scala coming from Hadoop and Java.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean started with EJB and Struts. Some of these ideas faded after the dot-com bust. Moved to Google, built Barcode scanner in Android. He chose to move towards Java to avoid C++. After Google got involved with open-source in a project that ended up being Apache Mahout. There were ML systems before Hadoop, but Hadoop attracted all those Java developers interested in the area. He worked with it until 2 years ago where he moved to Spark, and Scala.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common thread on most of this path is the JVM. For enterprise people, everything looks like Spring&#x2F;Maven&#x2F;etc, the standard stack. Your world view is defined by it, you mold problems to fit that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Hadoop in Java, instead of C++ which was used in Google for Map-Reduce? Officially due to the usual reasons: type-safe, garbage colector, easier to debug, libraries available, and platform independence. But Sean thinks there are other reasons: lots of people fled the dot-com burst to the safety of tech giants. Enterprise architecture meets web scale and Hadoop is born. A colleague thinks the real reason is Lucene used Java as an experiment, and Hadoop inherited that decision along the way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadoop has some functional ideas from the start. Map-reduce, HDFS (immutable file system), no side effects in mappers&#x2F;reducers. They probably were not taken directly from FP, they are just good ideas and assumptions that work well in a distributed environment, almost essential.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Hadoop &#x27;feels&#x27; enterprise-y. For example, a Mapper is a heavy-weight object instead of a simple function. It allows you to store state, exposes threading to you, makes you manage serialisation, etc. There may be reasons behind (performance, etc) but it&#x27;s not very functional.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a parallel world, Python grew in the &#x27;big-data&#x27; environment. Python is different: has an interpreter, sometype inference, has lambdas, libraries for ML, and pip to manage dependencies. Not at all like enterprise software. There are some nice things in the Python environment we wish we could have in the Java world (at that time). But if you are used to Java&#x27;s world you won&#x27;t realise you may want these things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we arrive to 2014, where functional invades the Hadoop ecosystem via Spark, Kafka, and Java 8 lambdas. Mentions to Storm and other similars projects that reinforce the trend. So suddenly the JVM has access to some of the features it was lacking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not about Spark replacing Map-reduce unexpectedly, we already had projects (like Crunch) that had improved in that area so the progression is &#x27;natural&#x27;, it has been coming for a while. This is just a next step in the evolution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do Scala&#x2F;Spark fit Hadoop? Many reasons:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immutable data at the foundation, perfect match between FP and Hadoop&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional paradigm from the start&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlocks caching due to immutability, at all levels from Spark to HDFS&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scala naturally from Java, which in turn replaced C++. Natural progression&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid imperative&#x2F;functional wins, easier to adapt to and quickly grab benefits&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory caching allows for fast iteration, which benefits data scientists as iteration is at the core of ML&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The provided Shell allows for exploratory analytics, makes it easier to prototype&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#x27;s more familiar to Python devs and the environment&#x2F;features they are used to&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I like about Scala as a former Java developer?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love collections, say what you will but they give you a lot of expressiveness&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love case classes and tuples, save you a lot of boilerplate&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love language constructs like val, lazy and match. They simplify and clarify what you intend to write&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love closures, which are much better than Java 8 lambdas, cleaner and slicker&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I dislike about Scala as a former Java developer?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dislike Option, not sure it&#x27;s way better than &lt;em&gt;null&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dislikes incompatible minor releases, has been very painful in Spark. A big deal for projects&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dislikes Sbt imperative style, still prefers Maven declarative style. Writing code in your build script is a step backwards when you try to understand somebody else Sbt build script.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dislike the fact &lt;em&gt;scalac&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is incredibly heavy. Yes, he understands the Scala compiler does so much more for you, but compiling park takes so long it seems crazy on 2015.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last complain about Scala community it&#x27;s the excessive fascination with syntax, sometimes using complex functional chain of operations to express simple ideas which could be expressed in a simpler way in Java.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala is, no doubt, the future for Hadoop ecosystem. That is good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Streams: reactive? functional? Or: akka- &amp;amp; scalaz- streams side-by-side&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;adamwarski&quot;&gt;Adam Warski&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of today is to see the differences between Akka and Scalaz streams. Most of the talk will be live coding, so please watch the video.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem we want to solve is to process data as it comes. We can&#x27;t hold all the data into memory for some reason, irrelevant why. We focus on scenarios with a single node which cover a lot of common scenarios, for multi-node computations please check Spark.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akka Streams introduces itself as a library to process and transfer a sequence of elements in a bounded buffer space.
Scalaz Streams is a streaming I&#x2F;O library focussed on compositionally, expressiveness and resource safety.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases we want to define a pipeline, in a type-safe way, and then run data through it. Scalaz-stream is slightly more typesafe than Akka Streams. In both libraries the first step is to create a &#x27;blue-print&#x27; (graph for Akka, process for Scalaz) that defines how to transform the data. After that is defined we can execute it (materialise in Akka, run in Scalaz).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic building blocks for Akka is a Graph (simple caseL linear pipeline), that has a source (produces elements), Sink (consumes an input) and some Flow pieces that transforms elements. At runtime each component is materialised into an Actor, and each actor does the operation defined in the relevant component. Each component also materialise into an additional value (example: Source into a Future you can use to get the result of the processing).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scalaz the approach is different. We initially create a data type &lt;code&gt;Process[F[_], T]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;T&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the output type, &lt;code&gt;F[_]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; describes side-effects that can occur while processing. In simplest case we have &lt;code&gt;Process[Nothing, T]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that emits &lt;code&gt;T&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; without any change. We also have aliases like &lt;code&gt;Sink[F[_],0] = Process[F, O =&amp;gt; F[Unit]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The Process is in fact akin to a state machine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akka implements the reactive-streams standard, which provides back-pressure via a back-channel, via dynamic push-pull. Source only produces data when the back-channel indicates it is needed, to avoid overwhelming components downstream. Everything is actor based, things happen concurrently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalaz has back-pressure for free as it is entirely pull-based. Elements are evaluated on by one, in a functional approach by which we only process one element once the state machine says we can do so. Not dependent on Scalaz except for &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. To be clear, Scalaz is slower than Akka version (2-3x).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Code examples via live-coding start, please watch video. I&#x27;ll try to summarise any key ideas mentioned)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Akka operations over the Source (like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) are converted into actors behind the scenes. The first example to manipulate a text file (read, filter, map and save) already creates at least 8 actors. You can&#x27;t influence the concurrency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code in Scalaz version looks similar, just using different types as Source. Scalaz calls &lt;code&gt;run&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; twice, first once compiles process into a &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, the second runs the &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. If you want parallelism you need to be explicit about it, there is none by default.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first test Akka took 3.84s while Scalaz took 6.93s. Take in account Scalaz was using a single thread (no parallelism defined).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example wants to transform Int to Int, processing odd and even elements in parallel. For Akka this means creating a FlowGrap that defines the data flow by first creating components of the Graph and then declaring the connections. Beware the graph correctness is checked at runtime, not at compile time! Adam comments that creating a component, &lt;code&gt;SplitStage&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, was complex and more so due to the use of a mutable API.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalaz version of the Int processing, all purely functional. Adam confesses it was hard to write the first time. Scalaz requires us to be explicit on parallelism, so we need to create bounded queues (for memory protection) and we use streams to add&#x2F;get elements to&#x2F;from them. We also need to close the queues once we are done. In the code we define several components, please watch the video to see the full structure (hard to describe without showing the code). All the code is purely functional with full control on side-effects. All the connections are checked at compile time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second test Akka took 3.43s and Scalaz 3.25s, as both were waiting for 1s during processing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Fast automatic type class derivation with shapeless&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;alxarchambault&quot;&gt;Alexandre Archambault&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelisation: in Scala you use a lot of case classes and sealed traits to represent your domain. Hundreds or more on big projects. The usual tasks include conversion to&#x2F;from JSON, persist in binary format, render as CSV, pretty-print, etc. You do this a lot, so you want to automate these tasks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use macros, but the Scala type system is quite complex and that means you need to consider a lot of things. Also, macros have some surprises within the API (side effects). All in all, using macros to automate these tasks becomes unwieldy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution is to use Shapeless instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first example is a &lt;code&gt;Printer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class that takes a value of type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and prints it. To explain how to do it, first let&#x27;s talk about &lt;code&gt;HLists&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;HLists&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are a sequence of types&#x2F;values, similar to Scala &lt;code&gt;List&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; except its elements may have different types inside the same list (&lt;code&gt;String :: Int :: HNil&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as an example). We can identify a &lt;code&gt;HList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to a case class of the same types.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can build &lt;code&gt;HLists&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; inductively, by prepending elements (&lt;code&gt;::&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), we can define our &lt;code&gt;Printer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class by recursively iterating over the &lt;code&gt;HList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and printing the values. We use support &lt;code&gt;Printer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for basic types (&lt;code&gt;Printer[String]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Printer[Int]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, etc) and as we can decompose the &lt;code&gt;HList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; into these basic components, we know we will print as expected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, we can map case classes to &lt;code&gt;HList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Given that, defining &lt;code&gt;Printer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in terms of &lt;code&gt;HList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (which is easy) provides us a way to print any existing case class in our code, including any case class we create in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are issues due to wrong divergences or recursive types. We can make our derivation more robust by using Shapeless&#x27; &lt;code&gt;Lazy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; type, which helps the compiler resolve the issues mentioned before and handles real recursion in types properly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A caveat to consider is that implicit priorities may cause issues in automatic generation. There are workarounds, like using &lt;code&gt;export-hook&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from Miles Sabin, or break implicits into an object hierarchy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to speed up the process, for example using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lihaoyi&#x2F;upickle-pprint&quot;&gt;upickle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a project that uses macros to help with type generation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Keynote: Typelevel - the benefits of collaboration&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;milessabin&quot;&gt;Miles Sabin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a different talk from the ones Miles usually gives, where he codes live. This one has slides! And no talking about Shapeless either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title was chosen months ago. This is about Typelevel and how collaboration is good. But, following Jessica&#x27;s talk, I feel the subtitle should be &#x27;The benefits of community&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Lars gave a keynote in this very stage. I watched that video and was astonished to how much has happened in the last year. Some very good, some not quite so great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s travel to September 2014, where Typelevel announced a fork of the Scala compiler. We wanted to push some prevalent Typelevel ideas into it, to fix some particular things. It&#x27;s something that can cause a lot of friction and disruption, but luckily the reaction was mostly positive. This shows that there is a big vibrant OS community around Scala. Shows that Typesafe is happy to let people help. It&#x27;s better to have people collaborate instead of moaning. EPFL also showed a generally positive feeling about the possible outcomes of experimentation and prototyping in Scala compiler.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, Scala Exchange 2014, Lars did his keynote. There was a friendly panel and everybody seemed going along very well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, something came to the spotlight: Typelevel is not only about technology and functional programming, it also wants to promote a good environment for minorities in the community. This caused Typelevel to adopt a code of conduct, seen as a means to an end: encourage good behaviour and deal with bad behaviour. Although most of the people accepted the code of conduct, this lead to a certain amount of drama in a part of the Scalaz community (where Lars was a primary maintainer). This had some cascading effects and shaped Typelevel since them up to now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that became clear is that Scalaz couldn&#x27;t continue as part of Typelevel. Lars stepped down as a Scalaz maintainer. But there was the need for the abstractions Scalaz provided for Typelevel libraries. As a consequence, Cats was created, to cover the technical needs while agreeing to the code of conduct, thus following Typelevel aims.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the drama, we realised it wasn&#x27;t clear to everybody else what is Typelevel about. So we needed to define Typelevel better to help people understand us besides our technical projects like Cats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is Typelevel? (Mind, the following is work-in-progress and Typelevel wants feedback on it). Typelevel is a community of projects and individuals organised around:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pure, typeful, functional programming in Scala (not in Haskell!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;independent free and open-source software, not linked to any organisation or company. Scala owes &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to the community, don&#x27;t forget it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a desire to share ideas and code&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessible and idiomatic learning resources&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inclusive, welcoming and safe environment&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is evolving, but what is we think Typelevel is about. Please watch Erik Osheim&#x27;s Scala World talk to see ways you can build open source communities. Very recommended.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typelevel has always been a collection of projects. Since one year ago we had some changes: Scalaz, Scalaz-streams and Argonaut left, other libraries like Circe, Cats, Dogs, and a few more joined. There&#x27;s been new tools, tests and laws like Ensime and tut (among others). There have also appeared several integration projects, like shapeless-argonaut, which enhance existing libraries; as well as macro&#x2F;plugin helpers which facilitate the job of library maintainers. A lot of stuff in one year :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typelevel Scala has not moved very much due to all the effort being put into Cats and related projects. But there have been tools developed that proof some concepts we wanted in the forked compiler, so some progress has been achieved. See George Leontiev&#x27;s Scala World talk for more details. There&#x27;s been some specific compiler work, minor, but it proves we can work with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some details on some of the libraries:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well stablished libraries like Scodec (binary data, very powerful and performant), Shapeless (generic programming) and Spire (numeric library for high precision operations). All widely used, directly or indirectly.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also well stablished are Discipline (law checking for type classes), ScalaCheck (automated property-based testing) and Spec2 (software specification)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have integrations, generic extensions of other libraries. For example, argonaut-shapeless.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have news things: Algebra, Cats, and Alleycats. Cats ia a Scalaz replacement. Algebra provides a set of algebraic type classes, comprising some fundamental type classes which are then used in Cats. Alleycats are lawless type classes and instances, which are also used in Cats.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s been a lot of activity lately. For example, since January 2015 there have been 1558 commits to Cats by 57 contributors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guiding principles for Algebra, Cats, and Alleycats:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;approachability: we want people to be able to approach the library much more easily than it was with Scalaz. For example, preference for text-based operators, make sure terminology is expressive enough instead of just focussing on the mathematical origin of the concept.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modularity: we broke Cats into submodules so it can be used as required instead of being a massive jar&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;documentation: we strive to have a massively improved documentation so we can convey useful information in a simple and centralised way&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;efficiency: we are willing to compromise and use (under the hood) non-functional constructs to improve performance. Watch Stew O&#x27;Connors talk at Scala by the Bay.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about Tut. It&#x27;s a markdown processor which interprets Scala in code blocks. This provides type-checked documentation, which helps us having useful and relevant documentation. It&#x27;s been even used by Underscore to produce a book, Essential Slick!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circe is a JSON library for Scala and Scala.js. Derived from Argonaut, uses &lt;em&gt;jawn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for parsing. Uses Monocle for lenses, works with Refined. Uses Shapeless for codec derivation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Miles is running out of time so it skips some stuff, like explaining other Typelevel libraries)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulacrum: provides annotations to automatically generate boilerplate when creating type classes. Machinist is a macro that eliminates overhead associated with Simulacrum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience with all these projects has influenced the way we think about the forked compiler. We have a better picture of the trade offs, and we can tackle small issues in helpers and bigger pieces in the compiler itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want people to get involved. We hope we have created an active and lively community. But we want you in. There is an up-to-date list of projects in our homepage. Most projects exist in Github and Gitter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Keynote: Scaling Intelligence: moving ideas forward&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jessitron&quot;&gt;Jessica Kerr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala as a language is about scaling. There is an inherent limit on development: what fits in our head (see this &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;complexity-simplicity-esb&quot;&gt;other talk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Jessica Kerr and Dan North). Given that limit, we need to scale outside of ourselves, use our team and community. People learn best in teams, people are not superstars by themselves, great teams create stars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what we do is not coding, nor learning, but teaching. We teach computer what to do, teach business about their own process (via requirement gathering), teach users via the UI we build, and we teach each other. Reusable code, flexible code, that is learnable code. A good commit message, that teaches what intention is behind the change. Documentation teaches what something does.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want people in our community as only that way we can scale that knowledge that makes us better. There are two things we need to know about Scala which we can only learn from members and group diversity:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarity: a teacher looks at the context of the learner, appreciates that context and adapts to that to teach. If something is not clear to you is not your fault, it is being explained wrong.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usefulness: if code is not useful then it doesn&#x27;t matter how correct it is. Determined by aggregate support of the community.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala is designed to scale the community. Scala is supposed to be a staircase, to start by using features that make more sense to us and gradually learn more things and advance. But currently you can hit roadblocks due to lack of context when trying to learn something, which forces you to learn stuff you do&#x27;t care about not or you are not ready to tackle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should write blogs, even for very basic information. Writing blogs helps less experienced people to find solutions to problems when they Google the error and they learn why something is that way. If many people do this we accelerate the community and help moving to next step in the language.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation written by leaders or experts of a community that know too much on the subject is too sparse as they have too much context. They can&#x27;t scale a community themselves. New joiners, with less experience, can help because they can identify what context is needed for an explanation. Scala can be hard, don&#x27;t feel stupid for nto understanding! Write and collaborate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your contribution is valuable. If something (blog post, stack overflow question) helps you, writing a post pointing to it and saying that helped you and how it was useful makes Google raise its relevance and helps the community to find it easily, helping all. Writing that makes you part of Scala. A language by itself doesn&#x27;t do anything, Scala is part of a programming system that includes libraries, tools, editors, AND the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from the Ruby community (and they can learn about language form us :P) It is a community that has scaled and it is still growing, still writing very useful software in it. We can learn on how they interact with each other, we can bring the same community scale to us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn things like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala values evolution vs stability. Ruby solved this dilema because libraries have a lot of maintainers, so they can be upgraded and evolve while being stable. In Scala with Typesafe, Typelevel you are still good. But other groups (Twitter, Foursquare, etc) which have few maintainers you are at risk, you don&#x27;t know when will they use newer idioms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is idiomatic scala? Still not clear, everybody&#x27;s Scala is different, and we spend time arguing about this while people leaves the community. We need to find a way, and only the community can do that, no one can tell us, no other community can offer us the solution. Ruby found a way to solve this issue and developed common idioms, we can too. Ruby spent time where people was reading each other&#x27;s useful code (business code, not library code), which helps spreading knowledge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should approach code with humility and respect for the reader. Be a teacher. For example: always include imports on your code examples and be explicit on the imports you use (not just ._). Give context.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware symbolic representations.They make things harder than necessary. Words are clearer than symbols and can be Googled, so really make sure that symbol is necessary. Naming in scala is a very strong asset, we should use this power more. Naming is hard, but then if it is hard, do it more! It is hard because you need to think about the problem you solve. So do it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid words like simply, obviously, etc... They tell you are supposed to know something you may not know. As a teacher, help the students by being more clear, providing links, helping to set a context for the action. Use&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Stack Overflow. Write blog posts. All that helps the community. We need to discuss not only the language and FP but also code style, tools, etc. Don&#x27;t just show syntax, teach me why is that option better, what is the concept behind. Make documentation better and more complete.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept help from newer users. Saying &#x27;no, that is not the right way&#x27; to a pull request you have closed the door of the community to that person. Accept pull-requests, even more so for documentation. If it is not great, help that person to improve but don&#x27;t shut the community&#x27;s door to new joiners.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming context or acting like someone is stupid for not knowing context is a bad idea. That will alienate people and hurt us as a group. Don&#x27;t define scala documentation in terms of learn you a Haskell. If you learn scala you want to learn Scala in Scala&#x27;s context, asking me to learn Haskell is not the way. Don&#x27;t ask me to learn category theory to write a useful business application. Give me the context I need to do what I want.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, publish boring Scala code that teaches business domain and how to build useful things to the community. Use that hashtag  #blueSkyScala to spread that knowledge to the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Functional Patterns for FP beginners&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;clementd&quot;&gt;Clément Delafargue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: you should watch the video once released to see more detailed examples on the concepts)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional programmer, day to day work with Javascript, but what I learned from Scala helped to write better JS. This talk is about simple patterns for FP. Not common abstractions like Functors or Monads, no Category Theory, but the tools we can use to build these abstractions. This is a way (of many possible) to do these things. Customise it to your needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala documentation in FP refers mostly to Haskell documentation, but if you don&#x27;t know Haskell that is a problem. Here we want to avoid that and focus on common FP patterns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FP (functional programming) being &#x27;programming with values&#x27;, where everything is an expression and you tweak values to get to the desired result. For example &lt;code&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is not a block anymore, is an expression that returns a value. Pattern match is not a substitute for switch, is a way to produce a value.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have Typed FP in Scala. All your expressions have types and you can type check the results, letting the compiler check the control flow and ensure correctness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;algebraic-data-types-adt&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#algebraic-data-types-adt&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: algebraic-data-types-adt&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Algebraic data types (ADT)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Algebraic Design, where you start with values, combine values and get desired values. Your workflow is data driven. So how do we model the data? Via Algebraic data types (ADT).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algebraic because they have two properties:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product types: compound type created by combining two or more types. Example: Tuple; case class User(name: String, age: Int)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sum types (or Co-products): a simple example is a Json value, which can be either a string, object, array or number. A Sum type is a group of values. In Scala this is implemented via a &lt;code&gt;sealed trait&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and we use pattern matching to work with them (deconstruct and inspect structure). Example:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sealed trait JsonElem

case classe JsonBoolean extends JsonElem

case classe JsonNumber extends JsonElem

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern matching raises compiler warnings if you forget a member of the Sum, which is handy. In Scala you can also combine Sum types to share elements across types. An example is Json is &#x27;root elements&#x27; or Json values (which can be only object or array) vs all possible Json elements.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sealed trait JsonElem
sealed trait JsonValue

case classe JsonBoolean extends JsonElem

case classe JsonNumber extends JsonElem

case classe JsonObject extends JsonElem with JsonValue

case classe JsonArray extends JsonElem with JsonValue

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOP makes it easy to add cases, while FP makes it easy to add functions. Compiler helps in both cases, but there is a trade-off for the developer. Thankfully in Scala you can choose the way you want to implement things as it gives both options.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you hand roll your own ADT or use generic types (like tuples or Either)? ADT are preferred unless you are deconstructing the result right away, as when the application grows your own ADT will help you more (compiler works for you).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sum and Product types keep properties of mathematical sum and product, like associativity, exponentials and factorisation. We have neutral value (Unit). For example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A * 1  =&amp;gt; A  and  (A, Unit) =&amp;gt; A
A + 0  =&amp;gt; A  and  A | Unit =&amp;gt; A

(User(&amp;quot;Me&amp;quot;, 27), Pet(&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;))  and  UserWithPet(&amp;quot;Me&amp;quot;, 27, &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;)
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; more examples in the video, watch it
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are equivalent but one gives more information via types:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sealed trait X
case class Bad(v: String) extends X
case class Good(v: String) extends X

case class Y(v: String, isGood: Boolean)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please void booleans in ADT, you want to use the types to provide information. Types make you more precise and allow compiler to type check.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADT are used to do Domain Driven Design, where you observe your data and build domain based on that. Much better than POJOs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;programming-with-contextualised-values&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#programming-with-contextualised-values&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: programming-with-contextualised-values&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Programming with Contextualised Values&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can program expressing into types if a computation failed, is asynchronous, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;error-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#error-handling&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: error-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Error handling&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Option&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; type is useful when only one thing can go wrong. For example when you parse String to Integer, there is no need of extra precision. It is simple to use, but restricted, if many things can go wrong you are losing information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Either&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a Sum type (Left -&amp;gt; Error, Right -&amp;gt; value) which allows you to handle several errors cases. Please use ADT to describe errors as Strings provide less information on the error type. With ADT you can handle all error cases. Beware &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is not biased in Scala and doesn&#x27;t work too well with type inference. You can use &lt;code&gt;Disjunction&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from Scalaz which behaves better and it&#x27;s biased (defaults to Right and provides flatMap operation to use inside a for-comprehension).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chained, both &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Disjunction&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; fail on the first error. Sometimes you want to accumulate errors, then you should use &lt;code&gt;Validation&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from Scalaz. The error list is a &lt;code&gt;NonEmptyList&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to ensure we have error messages on failure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to accumulate errors, some times you want to fail on first error. Don&#x27;t flatten your errors, decide what is what you want.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;extend-types&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#extend-types&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: extend-types&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Extend types&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;Monoid&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; allows you to combine 2 values and provides a neutral element. With subclassing you can&#x27;t declare a Zero element or extend Standard library classes (they are final). The workaround is to use &lt;code&gt;traits&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that provide the desired behaviour and that you pass as additional parameter to functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the work of explicitly passing that new type as a parameter, you declare the new type as implicit so the compiler autowires the proper implementation. Just be careful with Typeclass convergence where a type could have multiple implementations of the same behaviours, which causes problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulacrum library helps you creating typeclasses and boilerplate for these types.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(see examples from the talk when the video is published)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended to read Cats code as it is simple code and will help you understand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final tips as we are running out of time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use property testing for everything&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate effects from logic (Free Monads?)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read FP in Scala book&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

Building a CQRS application using the Scala Type System and Akka&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;renatocaval&quot;&gt;Renato Cavalcanti&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content of talk comes from current work done by Renato for the Belgium Government, so real world problems and lessons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CQRS: the idea behind is to have 2 objects, one which accepts commands and produces events, another object which receives the events and generates views on the model. If you don&#x27;t use event sourcing you need to produce event and save both write and read model in same transaction, otherwise you will lose event and data. If the commit fails, you have a problem. That is why event sourcing is important, as events can be stored and replayed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#command&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: command&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Command&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replaying events is very powerful, as you can use the stored events from production in a test environment to check all your components work as expected and produce the desired results. Facilitates verification of code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will show how to use CQRS in Akka, please watch video for full code examples. The examples uses mostly Akka-Http and Akka-Stream, two solutions for pretty well defined domains that help building the solution. The problem with Akka is that Akka is in fact a function to =&amp;gt; Any, which means you lose type safety and has its own problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to build something on top of Akka that isolates you from these issue. You find the building blocks of a CQRS system, following DDD: &lt;code&gt;DomainCommand&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DomainEvent&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Aggregate&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. These are traits that help you define your building blocks.
We also define some functions to validate events (which return a Future) and to construct Aggregates from DomainEvents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That solved, we have another issue to tackle. We need to persist the events, which we can do via Akka Persistence. We don&#x27;t store the message received in the actor, but the event generated as reaction to that message. If an Aggregate (implemented as an actor) is restarted, it can recover its status from reading the chain of events in the event-store.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all this to work we need a Protocol, a set of command and events for a given Aggregate. We also define the Behaviour (mapping between commands and events). We can create a DSL to facilitate generating Behaviours for an Aggregate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Renato now shows code showcases the implementation of a Protocol, the corresponding Behaviour DSL and an Aggregate. Please watch video for more details]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have Aggregate, Protocol and Behaviour then I can create an AggregateManager, an Actor, that creates AggregateActors and manages its life-cycle. Your AggregateService is fully typed, via the protocol, and the Manager abstracts the Akka details from you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;query&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#query&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: query&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Query&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Query side is about reading the events and producing Views on the data. We use Akka Persistence Query, an experimental feature. An actor generates a Projection from the events, so we don&#x27;t need to recalculate the status every time (snapshot-style). Each projection has an id to identify it and provide versioning. The actor doesn&#x27;t accept new events while generating a Projection, only after it has finished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Renato now shows code of the Query part of the system]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Projection object is not typed, as usually you handle multiple events in a single projection. A future improvement is to strongly type projections, but not there yet. A Projection also has more data than the Aggregate stores, as there may be inferred data that is valuable for the business when viewing data, but we don&#x27;t need to store explicitly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSL used by Renato also provides methods to &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; a Projection, so we can detect events and, for example, wait until all events required are received before generating a projection result.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeways&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#takeways&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: takeways&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Takeways&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a Protocol, Behaviour and Aggregate then you can have an actor that understand the life-cycle and a fully typed AggregateService.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command validations can usually be asynchronous, but events must be pure and always succeed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Keynote: Without Resilience, Nothing Else Matters&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jboner&quot;&gt;Jonas Bonér&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your application is not available, doing something useful, nothing else matters: quality, speed, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It isn&#x27;t about how hard you hit, is about how hard can you be hit and keep moving forward. [...] That&#x27;s how winning is done.&quot; (from Rocky Movie)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fault tolerance is not enough. Resilience is beyond fault tolerance, and it&#x27;s all that matters. Resilience is the ability to spring back into shape, to recover quickly from difficulties. Software today can be incredibly complex, and we need to understand resilience in the context of these complex systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complicated system has multiple small parts that interact to do something. It can be understood, although it is hard. A complex system is made of many similarly interacting parts with simple rules (ala Game of Life). Those rules define emerging properties which are impossible to understand. You can understand individual rules, but not the full interactions and outcomes. Complicated is not the same a Complex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex systems run in degraded mode. Complex systems run as broken systems. In a Complex system there is something failing somewhere, always! And humans make things worse, as complex systems are counterintuitive and when we use intuition we usually end up worsening the existing issues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex systems operate at the edge of failure. There is the economic failure boundary, where you can run out of business. There is the unacceptable workload boundary where you can&#x27;t cope with the work. There is the accident boundary, when an undefined event causes us to fail. The operating point moves between these boundaries, and if it crosses one of them we fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we have 3 pressures on the operating point. Management tries to minimise economic failure, workload tends to least effort, and as a result we are pushing the point towards the accident boundary which is undefined. We try to counteract with tools, systems, but this keeps happening as we can&#x27;t understand all implications. The only solution is to add an error margin to protect us from failure, so when we get into dangerous territory we can act before we fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we don&#x27;t know much, if anything, about the failure boundary so it is hard to define a proper error boundary. And we keep pushing it closer to the failure boundary as the system looks stable to us, until the point where the boundary is not helping anymore and we fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must embrace failure. We know complex systems always work as broken system, so we need to accept failure as normality. We must understand that resilience is by design, it can&#x27;t be bolted in afterwards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the animal kingdom simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience&quot;. Complexity may help building resilience. Another example on how complexity builds resilience is how the current world protects us: it feeds us, give sus shelter, etc. And it is very complex. So we can learn about resilience in both biological and social systems:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature diversity and redundancy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interconnected network structure&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide distribution&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity to self-adapt and self-organise&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this apply to computer systems? We need to change the way we manage failure. Failure is natural and expected. One way: Let it crash, like Erlang does.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have Crash Only software (name of a paper). Stop is equal to crash safely. Start is equal to recover fast from a crash. We can apply this recursively and turn the big sledgehammer into a scalpel to tolerate failures at many levels. It is recommended to read the paper.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a way out of the &#x27;State Tar Pit&#x27; (another paper). A lot of failure is related to data (partial data, wrong data, etc). We have input data, provided by customers, and derived data, data we compute from the input data. The critical one is input data, that we need to keep and take care of to avoid annoying users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the traditional way of managing state a error at the end of an input path will cause all the path to fail and we will lose the input data, which is an utterly broken way to manage this. We react to this by abusing defensive programming, adding try-catch blocks everywhere, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Accidents come from relationships, not broken parts.&quot; A Sane failure model means that Failures need to be:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contained to avoid cascading failures&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reified as messages&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signalled asynchronously&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observed by at least 1 actor, up to N observers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the bulkhead pattern used by ship industry. If a compartment breaks the ship is not affected. But we can still do better, by adding Supervision: observe and manage failures from a healthy context. Components that fail should notify the Supervisor so something can be done about it. An &#x27;Onion Later State &amp;amp; Failure management&#x27; or &#x27;Error Kernel pattern&#x27;. The kernel delegates all work and supervises so the task is performed correctly, managing any errors as necessary. We apply this recursively, with a layer managing failures of the underlying level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&#x27;t put all eggs in same basket. We need to maintain diversity and redundancy. Servers crash, AWS goes down. We need multiple servers, even multiple data centers, which means running a distributed system. And they should be decoupled in time (to enable concurrency) and space (enables mobility of nodes). This gives a very solid base for resilience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to decompose systems using consistency boundaries. We need to think about isolation of components. We need to start with the weakest consistency guarantees we can, and add stronger ones as we go if we need them. The less ACID and coordination you need, the better. Within the boundary we can have strong consistency (example: actors are single threaded with an inbox). Between boundaries it is a &#x27;zoo&#x27;, all bets are off, we need to manage failure as described above. But that is good, as weak coupling and other properties of the &#x27;zoo&#x27; enhance our resilience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: strong consistency is the wrong default, it adds too strong coupling, but what we need is to decompose systems and create safe islands (consistency boundaries).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, let&#x27;s talk about resilient protocols, the way to manage the &#x27;zoo&#x27; outside consistency boundaries. They depends on asynchronous communication and eventual consistency. They must embrace ACID 2.0 (Associative, Commutative, Idempotent, Distributed); they must be tolerant to message loss, reordering, and duplication.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

A purely functional approach to building large applications&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;noelmarkham&quot;&gt;Noel Markham&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talks follow a bit on his talk last year about &#x27;Introduction to Scalaz&#x27;. We will look at tools and techniques and how to do things in a more purely functional manner. (Talk will be heavy on screen-coding, so please watch the video! I will try to summarise the concepts explained, but without seeing the code it may not make too much sense)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by breaking rules and using &lt;code&gt;import scalaz._; import Scalaz._&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and other generic imports. Sorry Jessica Kerr ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting point are a couple of API which are not too flexible but we can&#x27;t modify, they are external API.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First concept: let&#x27;s talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Markov_chain&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Markov Chains&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We want to build a structure to, given 2 words, try to guess what would be the next word and a function that would use that to generate possible sentences. We could use a method that returns a &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and use &lt;code&gt;Await.result&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; over the external API and then use the result to the generator. We can improve that by using a for-comprehension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can improve the code more by extracting the configuration. Side concept: we can compose functions (f andThen g), but a function can be considered a Functor, so it can be mapped over! So we can group all our configuration into a case class and create functions &lt;code&gt;Config =&amp;gt; String&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Config =&amp;gt; Int&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to extract config. And we can group those functions to extract several values at once. We can go further and use functions as Monads to extract config (via the functions) using a for-comprehension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all we did above, we can create functions that given a config (as a parameter) return a function that will return what we want (tweets, other data). We can do the same for the string generator, to make it depend on config. And then we can use both in a for-comprehension as functions are Monads, although we still have the Future type around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can tackle that Future type by wrapping the function with a Reader type. Then we need to understand the concept of Monad transformers, which allows us to &lt;em&gt;unwrap&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a monad to interact with it&#x27;s element. For example, given a &lt;code&gt;Future[Option[Int]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; we can interact with the &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; directly, without having to call a method in &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. In Scalaz that would be &lt;code&gt;OptionT[Future, Int]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Given Monad transformers, we can then work with &lt;code&gt;ReaderT&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which will allow us to ignore the Future in our methods until we really want to. This gives us a &lt;code&gt;ReaderT[Future, String, Int]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which allows us to work with all the elements of our computation independently (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kleisli_category&quot;&gt;kleisli&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our example, we can then change our functions to become &lt;code&gt;kleisli&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ReaderT[Future, Config, List[Tweet]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ReaderT[Future, Config, String]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. We have separated constituent types and we can deal with each one as we need to. Which helps us produce a very sane for-comprehension, very legible and understandable. And we get as result a &lt;code&gt;Future[String]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; but that is at the end of the calculation, so we block at a point after we defined all the task to do, decoupling task from execution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage is that this makes this code easier to test. Our methods take functions as arguments, a home-grown dependency injection system where we can plug anything we want (respecting types!) so we can test the code without interacting with 3rd party services or doing other steps of the process. No need to mock, just use simple stubs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suggestion to test is to use ScalaCheck. With ScalaCheck you suggest properties for your code, and the framework makes sure your properties hold by trying to find values that break them. (Also adding a dash of Shapeless, because why not). With this we can, for example, make sure our code doesn&#x27;t modify the text of the tweets in any way by default.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can still do better, let&#x27;s try to abstract over ReaderT. Right now we are only using ReaderT as Mond, so we may as well replace it by &lt;code&gt;M[List[Tweet]]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;M[String]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on our functions. Our for-comprehension doesn&#x27;t change, but it has other benefits. For example, our test code can be simpler as we can use the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (identity) monad to generate values.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s say we now want to add logging to it. How can we tackle this? Let&#x27;s assume we are given a method &lt;code&gt;log&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that returns a &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. We can integrate this as a parameter &lt;code&gt;String =&amp;gt; M[Unit]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and we are done. Except we don&#x27;t like side-effects and &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. We can wrap the log in a &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which allows us to do an operation and do an additional operation into a secondary store (basically, a log). With this we replace our &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to integrate the logging, but both are Monads so the signatures and for-comprehension don&#x27;t change, only implementation details. (Note: I may have missed some detail in that last part! Check the video.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this process, we found nice ways to provide configuration, wire functions (akin to dependency injection) and abstract over Monads, all by leveraging the power of libraries like Scalaz, Shapeless, and ScalaCheck. And by using the libraries you reduce boilerplate and make code easier to understand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: you really need to see the slides with the code to follow the talk fully, very recommended talk if you are interested in FP.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Exploiting Dependent Types for Safer, Faster Code&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;propensive&quot;&gt;Jon Pretty&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an advanced feature of Scala&#x27;s type system. Not difficult to use, but writing libraries that use them can be complex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#x27;Slippery road&#x27; represent a dynamic language, where you can&#x27;t control the types and you have no guidance. Throughout the talk an example library will be used: Raptured command-line.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: a bash command&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls -lah --sort time --width=120
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to convert that to Scala. We can try to parse the arguments into Scala values. We may even specify a type parameter so the parsing doesn&#x27;t return a String but an Int. We may want to use several representations for a value (-s, --size). All this an be abstracted further into a value of type &lt;code&gt;Param[Int](&#x27;s&#x27;, &quot;size&quot;)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Nothing too exciting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s stash that for a moment and talk about Rapture I18N, a library to support I18N Strings in apps. The standard solution is to use string bundles, one per language, managed separately from the code itself. But what if you forget to add a translation for a sentence in a language? You get a runtime error. Rapture I18N embeds the languages in the source and makes the compiler check for completeness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some examples of Rapture I18N follow)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A type behind Rapture I18N is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class IString[L1] {
	def |[L2](that: IString[L2]): IString[L1 with L2] = ???
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gives us a type intersection, a type per language, and we track the contents of an IString as if it was a map of language type to string. The intersection type &lt;code&gt;En with De&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; means the type is both an &lt;code&gt;En&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;De&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. In Scala we can create an intersection between any two types, for example: &lt;code&gt;Int with String&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. A type can exists even if we can&#x27;t have instance of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kind of types are called &lt;code&gt;phantom types&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which exist purely for compiler benefit, they will never be instantiated. After compilation they get erased, they don&#x27;t exist in bytecode (type erasure). But the compiler can use them to enforce constraints on other types and to drive implicit resolution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example we can use the constraint enforce to make sure &lt;code&gt;sayHi[Ru]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will fail compilation if we didn&#x27;t define a &lt;code&gt;Ru&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; version of Hi. We can do that by requiring a supertype of the phantom type &lt;code&gt;V &amp;gt;:T&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Given &lt;code&gt;En with De&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;En&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a supertype and will compile, but &lt;code&gt;Ru&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is not a supertype and it will fail compilation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all accesses are checked at compile time, we know they are safe operations and total functions, which we know won&#x27;t fail. But we don&#x27;t know which times we are going to access at compile time, we will know at runtime time. How can we convert the string indicating language from the user into a type? What if they send a request for a language that doesn&#x27;t exist?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can write parsers like &lt;code&gt;(en | de).parse(inputLang)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which becomes the only point of failure at runtime. We can&#x27;t avoid that, but all the rest of the code has been checked at compile time, so we know we can handle the exceptional cases in there and do not worry anymore about I18N types. Narrowing failure points is good for programming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quick demo on Rapture I18N follows)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the demo, back to the Command Line problem stated at the start. We want to enforce some constrains on the parameters passed to a command line instruction. We can do it naively via pattern matching and for comprehension, but could do better and try to reduce this to a single point of failure as we did with the I18n library.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We potentially have a complex structure of conjunctions and disjunctions over parameter preferences and alternative representations. We can represent them in Scala types, so &lt;code&gt;A &amp;amp; B &amp;amp; C&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;Product[A with B with C]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;A | B | C&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;CoProduct[A with B with C]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. And then we define combinators for &lt;code&gt;|&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (see slides for definitions, basically pattern matching grouping parameters into &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CoProduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instances). The result will be a complex type built following the defined combinations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these definitions we can do as we did with I18N, reducing the point of failure to &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (Note: you will need to see the slides&#x2F;video to follow the code that generates all this, can&#x27;t reproduce in this summary).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary: multiple failure points increase the burden on error handling. Instead we want to handle all failures together, up-front. Use total functions and many more operations are now dafe, with more code becoming free of distracting error handling. We have reduced the surface of failure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions: dependent types will be increasingly important in the future of typed languages. Work will be around make it easier to write. In Scala, error messages CAN be improved, we can have better tooling to manage them. Hopefully we will have more code that consists entirely of total functions, with very reduce surface for error. Lastly, this additional information provided by the types can offer opportunities to improve performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Lighting Talks - Track 1&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ozgus4000&quot;&gt;Andrew (Gus) Gustafson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - Making your life easier with macros&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: write out a class using snake case JSON field names. By default you need to override a method provided by some JSON library to provide what you want. Or for example, if you want to convert an ADT to JSON, to process the parent sealed trait you need a (potentially big) pattern match for every possible child.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macros are a simple way to generate this &#x27;boilerplate&#x27; code, following a DRY principle. Write macro once, apply everywhere, without duplicating code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips and Tricks for Macros:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;println&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is your friend. Auto-complete too. Keep typing until something good happens&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macro code needs to be in a separate codebase than your domain model&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Code example follows)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jamiepullar&quot;&gt;Jamie Pullar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - Handling Partially Dynamic Data&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtitle: exploring a DSL approach to lenses with Jsentric and Dsentric.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of partially dynamic data:  given a JSON object we validate only fields of interest in the server. Or microservices supporting arbitrary content structures, they only care about specific fields and ignore the rest of the data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first challenge: how do we deserialise data to work with it? Use type safe structures (ADT vs Map[String, Any]).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to extract the data we want? We can use Lenses to extract the fields we want. Lenses allow us to target parts of the data and operate with it. The issue is that it can become a bit unwieldy code wise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve code verbosity we introduce a Contract structure, which defines the structure we care about. Then we can use it to pattern match over the input data (for example JSON) and work with the relevant values, while not relevant data is silently ignored. The Contract allows us to read, modify, and delete the relevant values. Using Shapeless we can improve usability by providing helpers which reduce boilerplate even more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can extend the Contract to add validations, as precise as we need (example: age &amp;gt; 0 and &amp;lt; 150). These validations can be type safe. Further extension allows us to build querying over the structures, so we can filter the data. All this is possible because the Contract is abstracting the data structure from our business logic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dsentric is custom contract configuration with Monocle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Lighting Talks - Track 1&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;leakimav&quot;&gt;Mikael Valot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - Flexible data structures in Scala&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Talk heavy on code examples, check slides for more clarity)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project &lt;code&gt;Strucs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Case classes are not composable. How can I define common fields only once without using Shapeless records?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structs enables you to concatenate case classes via &lt;code&gt;+&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; operator to generate new types. So you can create one case class per each field, and concatenate to generate a composite type. Compiler checks to avoid field duplication. You can compose these struct types, so having a &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; you can then have a &lt;code&gt;Person with Address&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that includes values of both.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These compositions can be used in structural types, so you can define a type parameter &lt;code&gt;T &amp;lt;: Age with Name&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to ensure type safety of your operations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, a Struct is a &lt;code&gt;Struct[F](private val fields: Map[StructKey, Any])&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, where all access to the map is via parametrised types, for example &lt;code&gt;get[T](implicit k: StructKeyProvider[T], ev: F &amp;lt;:&amp;lt; T): T&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. This should avoid the issues usually related to using &lt;code&gt;Any&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struct enables us to provide automatic JSON encode&#x2F;decode via macros.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Lighting Talks - Track 1&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;nick_engb&quot;&gt;Nick Pollard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - More Typing, Less Typing - Driving behaviour with types&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala has a very powerful type system. What is it good for? Usually we though about Validation, what about generating behaviour? We do that all the time, for example when we overload methods or we use Typeclasses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typeclasses revisited: interface across type, common capability but varied behaviour by type. Each instance provides behaviour, implemented using &lt;code&gt;trait&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and used via &lt;code&gt;implicit&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Instances are defined as implicit values and def. Implicit def can take another implicit as parameter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When searching for an implicit the compiler can chain successive implicits if it will produce the required type.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we handle more complex types via implicits? We need an algebra for types. An algebra is just a group of objects and operators you can use on those objects. Like numbers and mathematical operators, or types and type operators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we operate on types? What is a type? A type can be seen as a set of values. Example: &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Set(true, false)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Set(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, ...)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. So we can use Set operators, of which we care about two, &lt;code&gt;product&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (cartesian product) and &lt;code&gt;coproduct&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (also named disjoint union, like Scalaz &#x2F;, or sum).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this we can express types in the terms of operators. &lt;code&gt;Option[A] = () \&#x2F; A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can model types as operators in simple types, we can construct typeclasses from that. This is what Shapeless does for this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapeless uses HList (heterogeneous lists). Equivalent to nested tuples &lt;code&gt;(A, (B, C))&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The base case is HNil, we can recurse over the list until we hit HNil. Shapeless also provides CoProduct, similar to Tuples of &lt;code&gt;\&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (simplifying).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is that useful? It allows us, for example, to generate parsers for any type of case class by treating them as HList. Shapeless automatically turns ADTs into HList (it has implicits and macros to do that). This reduces boilerplate, we write a generic parser once and we can apply it to any present or future ADT we use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After hearing a lot about the benefits of using Emacs to code in Scala, I&#x27;ve decided to give it a go and also to document the steps to work with it, in case anyone else feels crazy enough to try this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#why&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Why?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess first I should explain why would I use Emacs when there are products like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;idea&#x2F;?fromMenu&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which provide a lot of functionality and are easy (easier?) to use. This is a personal decision, but some reasons I&#x27;ve found to try Emacs are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDEA sometimes shows misleading errors with Scalaz. Add some EitherT or similar to your code and suddenly correct code that is built by Sbt with no complains is flagged red by IDEA. This is because they use their own compiler, and although it seems a minor issue it can become annoying (is this IDEA acting or did I break it?) and fixing it requires adding explicit type annotations to your code, which means more verbosity and less readable code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource efficiency. This last summer, due to me changing jobs, I had to bring back to life my 7 year old desktop with its non-ssd hard drive and only 4 Gb of ram. Trying to code in it was extremely annoying. I had only IDEA, a browser and a terminal open, but it felt clunky and focussing was hard due to constant system slowdowns. Replacing IDEA by a simple text editor helped a lot, but there was a lack of syntax highlighting and other tooling I was used to. I don&#x27;t know if&#x2F;when I may find myself in a similar situation again, so being comfortable with a leaner IDE has become relevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhs.uk&#x2F;conditions&#x2F;Repetitive-strain-injury&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;Introduction.aspx&quot;&gt;RSI&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Luckily I&#x27;m not suffering from it but I&#x27;m a frequent customer of physiotherapy due to heavy mouse use harming my shoulders. I&#x27;ve been told repeatedly that Emacs is a great environment to reduce these muscular issues, better than IDEA, so it&#x27;s worth the effort.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the new &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;press&#x2F;pr_030915.html&quot;&gt;payment policy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Jetbrains; I&#x27;ve been paying for my license for years and renewing for each new version, so it would make no difference to me. But the change highlights the dangers of being tied to a proprietary tool and unexpected changes to them. If we believe in the software craftsmanship movement and we care about our tools, we need full control on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest, knowing Emacs sounds cool. I may fail on the task and realise I&#x27;m not the nerd I expected to be, but it&#x27;s worth the test ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#environment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: environment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Environment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m going to install Emacs in a MacBook Pro with Yosemite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several Emacs packages you can choose from, the one I&#x27;ve been recommended is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syl20bnr&#x2F;spacemacs&quot;&gt;Scapemacs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; so I&#x27;ll be trying this one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Scala goodness I&#x27;ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ensime&quot;&gt;Ensime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and its Emacs plugin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t research any other plugins by now, geting used to Emacs is enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-spacemacs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#installing-spacemacs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: installing-spacemacs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Installing Spacemacs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacemacs is a bundle of configuration and plugins for Emacs, as a consequence before starting you will need Emacs installed. As of today Spacemacs recommends to use the &lt;code&gt;emacs-mac-port&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; package, available in Homebrew:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	$ brew tap railwaycat&amp;#x2F;emacsmacport
	$ brew install emacs-mac --with-spacemacs-icon
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, it is recommended to backup your current Emacs config:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	cd ~
	mv .emacs.d .emacs.bak
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install Spacemacs, just clone the repo along its submodules to &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.emacs.d&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	git clone --recursive https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;syl20bnr&amp;#x2F;spacemacs ~&amp;#x2F;.emacs.d
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done, launch Emacs and wait for the set up to be done:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	$ emacs
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scala-and-emacs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#scala-and-emacs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: scala-and-emacs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Scala and Emacs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacemacs provides integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ensime&quot;&gt;Ensime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syl20bnr&#x2F;spacemacs&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;!lang&#x2F;scala&quot;&gt;this package&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It works as a layer, to install it just edit your &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.spacemacs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file and find &lt;code&gt;dotspacemacs-configuration-layers&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; near the top of the file. Add &lt;code&gt;scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as a new layer:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
	   &amp;#x27;(
	     ;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
	     ;; Example of useful layers you may want to use right away.
	     ;; Uncomment some layer names and press &amp;lt;SPC f e R&amp;gt; (Vim style) or
	     ;; &amp;lt;M-m f e R&amp;gt; (Emacs style) to install them.
	     ;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
	     ;; auto-completion
	     ;; better-defaults
	     emacs-lisp
	     ;; git
	     ;; markdown
	     ;; org
	     ;; (shell :variables
	     ;;        shell-default-height 30
	     ;;        shell-default-position &amp;#x27;bottom)
	     ;; syntax-checking
	     version-control
	     scala
	     )
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then restart Emacs. Next create a global &lt;code&gt;plugins.sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.sbt&#x2F;0.13&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;plugin.sbt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and add to it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo(&amp;quot;snapshots&amp;quot;)

	addSbtPlugin(&amp;quot;org.ensime&amp;quot; % &amp;quot;ensime-sbt&amp;quot; % &amp;quot;0.1.5-SNAPSHOT&amp;quot;)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run sbt once in some of your projects to download the dependency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work with a Scala project you will need to create a &lt;code&gt;.ensime&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file by running&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	sbt gen-ensime
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the root.  To load Ensime, type &lt;code&gt;SPC : ensime&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and wait until the environment is configured, which may take a while the first time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-spacemacs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#learning-spacemacs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: learning-spacemacs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Learning Spacemacs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Emacs loads all the configuration you are welcomed by... an ugly yellow screen. Ugh. Yes, it will take a while to get used to this, no one said it would be easy ;) There are two resources I&#x27;m using to get started:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sachachua.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png&quot;&gt;How to Learn Emacs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syl20bnr&#x2F;spacemacs#learning-spacemacs&quot;&gt;Learning Spacemacs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the Evil-adapted Vimtutor to get familiar with the key bindings. Press &lt;code&gt;SPC h T&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to launch it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-day-feelings&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#first-day-feelings&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: first-day-feelings&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
First day feelings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hard. I&#x27;m ashamed to acknowledge how long did it take me to open a file in Emacs, much less to compile it via Sbt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see the benefits of learning Emacs and not having to use the mouse much, but it will take effort to get used to this and to get the &#x27;right&#x27; environment setup working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-repl/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things people love about Scala is the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&quot;&gt;REPL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I have to be honest;
I never paid too much attention to it as IntelliJ provides a handy &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jetbrains.com&#x2F;scala&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;23&#x2F;meet-the-new-scala-worksheets-in-intellij-idea&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala Worksheet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. But it is time to fix this..&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that my old desktop started misbehaving and running IntelliJ slows it down to a crawl. While I find a suitable replacement, I had to settle with using Sublime Text 2 to toy around with some Scala code. Is at this point that my lack of knowledge of the REPL became obvious, and a hindrance. And what better way to help fix that issue than to document the relevant parts :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely you are using the new &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typesafe.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;core-tools&#x2F;activator-and-sbt&quot;&gt;Activator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to generate your projects. Activator has a lot of commands:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ .&amp;#x2F;activator
[info] Loading project definition from &amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;pvillega&amp;#x2F;Dropbox&amp;#x2F;Projectes&amp;#x2F;scala-fp-exercises&amp;#x2F;project
[info] Set current project to scala-fp-exercises (in build file:&amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;pvillega&amp;#x2F;Dropbox&amp;#x2F;Projectes&amp;#x2F;scala-fp-exercises&amp;#x2F;)
&amp;gt; help

  help                                    Displays this help message or prints detailed help on requested commands (run &amp;#x27;help &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&amp;#x27;).
  completions                             Displays a list of completions for the given argument string (run &amp;#x27;completions &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&amp;#x27;).
  about                                   Displays basic information about sbt and the build.
  tasks                                   Lists the tasks defined for the current project.
  settings                                Lists the settings defined for the current project.
  reload                                  (Re)loads the current project or changes to plugins project or returns from it.
  projects                                Lists the names of available projects or temporarily adds&amp;#x2F;removes extra builds to the session.
  project                                 Displays the current project or changes to the provided `project`.
  set [every] &amp;lt;setting&amp;gt;                   Evaluates a Setting and applies it to the current project.
  session                                 Manipulates session settings.  For details, run &amp;#x27;help session&amp;#x27;.
  inspect [uses|tree|definitions] &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;   Prints the value for &amp;#x27;key&amp;#x27;, the defining scope, delegates, related definitions, and dependencies.
  &amp;lt;log-level&amp;gt;                             Sets the logging level to &amp;#x27;log-level&amp;#x27;.  Valid levels: debug, info, warn, error
  plugins                                 Lists currently available plugins.
  ; &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; (; &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;)*              Runs the provided semicolon-separated commands.
  ~ &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;                             Executes the specified command whenever source files change.
  last                                    Displays output from a previous command or the output from a specific task.
  last-grep                               Shows lines from the last output for &amp;#x27;key&amp;#x27; that match &amp;#x27;pattern&amp;#x27;.
  export &amp;lt;tasks&amp;gt;+                         Executes tasks and displays the equivalent command lines.
  exit                                    Terminates the build.
  --&amp;lt;command&amp;gt;                             Schedules a command to run before other commands on startup.
  show &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;                              Displays the result of evaluating the setting or task associated with &amp;#x27;key&amp;#x27;.
  all &amp;lt;task&amp;gt;+                             Executes all of the specified tasks concurrently.

More command help available using &amp;#x27;help &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&amp;#x27; for:
  !, +, ++, &amp;lt;, alias, append, apply, eval, iflast, onFailure, reboot, shell
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snippet above only shows the most relevant ones, but there are plenty more (278 as I write this) although just a few are used very often:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; projects        # lists the projects available
&amp;gt; project &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;  # changes to the given project (run will execute the selected project now)
&amp;gt; plugins         # lists all plugins
&amp;gt; reload          # reloads all the config and plugins without leaving the session
&amp;gt; run             # runs the current project
&amp;gt; ~test           # runs the tests. The initial ~ means it will run them all every time a source file changes, handy for TDD
&amp;gt; exit            # leaves activator
&amp;gt; console         # launches Scala REPL
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see with a few commands you cover most of your development needs. But as we were talking about REPL the command I want to focus on is &lt;code&gt;console&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which starts a REPL in the currently selected project:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; console
[info] Starting scala interpreter...
[info]
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.6 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala&amp;gt; :help
All commands can be abbreviated, e.g., :he instead of :help.
:edit &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;line&amp;gt;        edit history
:help [command]          print this summary or command-specific help
:history [num]           show the history (optional num is commands to show)
:h? &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;             search the history
:imports [name name ...] show import history, identifying sources of names
:implicits [-v]          show the implicits in scope
:javap &amp;lt;path|class&amp;gt;      disassemble a file or class name
:line &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;line&amp;gt;        place line(s) at the end of history
:load &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;             interpret lines in a file
:paste [-raw] [path]     enter paste mode or paste a file
:power                   enable power user mode
:quit                    exit the interpreter
:replay [options]        reset the repl and replay all previous commands
:require &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;          add a jar to the classpath
:reset [options]         reset the repl to its initial state, forgetting all session entries
:save &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;             save replayable session to a file
:sh &amp;lt;command line&amp;gt;       run a shell command (result is implicitly =&amp;gt; List[String])
:settings &amp;lt;options&amp;gt;      update compiler options, if possible; see reset
:silent                  disable&amp;#x2F;enable automatic printing of results
:type [-v] &amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;        display the type of an expression without evaluating it
:kind [-v] &amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;        display the kind of expression&amp;#x27;s type
:warnings                show the suppressed warnings from the most recent line which had any
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see there aren&#x27;t many commands in the REPL, which makes it very easy to use even for the uninitiated. Some of them deserve additional attention as you will run them often.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example &lt;code&gt;:implicits&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will show a list of all implicits in scope. Given implicits are problematic (judging by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;search?q=%5Bscala%5D+implicit&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; questions), this may help when debugging your app.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main drawbacks of a REPL is to type all the context (imports, type definitions, etc) you need before you can test stuff. Two commands remove this pain: &lt;code&gt;:load &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will read and interpret a file as if you had typed it into the terminal; the command &lt;code&gt;:paste&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; works similarly by starting a &lt;em&gt;paste mode&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that allows you to copy-paste relevant code into the REPL.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;scala&amp;gt; :paste
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

val s = 3
def g = (x: Int) =&amp;gt; x*x

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

s: Int = 3

&lt;p&gt;Alongside &lt;code&gt;:load&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; there is a corresponding &lt;code&gt;:save &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command which saves the current status of the REPL into a file that can be loaded later on to continue your work at that point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other commands you may want to check, like &lt;code&gt;:require&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:history&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, but with just the ones above working inside the REPL becomes a much more pleasant experience and not having a full fledge IDE is less of an issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/using-docker-in-heroku/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Heroku has announced &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;getting-started-with-scala-and-heroku-local-docker-development&quot;&gt;beta support&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Docker containers running in its platform. As I have some time in my hands, I&#x27;ve tried how well it integrates.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 15&#x2F;5&#x2F;2015:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Michael Friss from Heroku sent me an email regarding the concerns I raised, update at the end with his comments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make before I start: I was a Heroku convert that left the flock but is heading back to it. Years ago, when Heroku added support for Play apps, I made the same mistake as many developers before: I built my own (crappy) blog engine. I don&#x27;t know if the code is still around but for the sake of my employability I won&#x27;t surface any link to it ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Heroku was very convenient, albeit expensive: $37&#x2F;month for a personal blog with dozens of visits per month... not a sound idea. I ended up looking for alternatives and realised the obvious: AWS, Linode and others were way cheaper and provided much more power. So I moved away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve come full cycle. A couple of weeks ago, at a HackTheTower event organised by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jr0cket&quot;&gt;John Stevenson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who&#x27;s a Heroku evangelist, I asked him why should I use Heroku as it is quite pricey. His answer: you pay for a 3rd party DevOps team. Obvious an answer as it is, the experience acquired between the time I used Heroku and now made me realise how valuable that is if you are building a serious app.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Docker I went ballistic trying to run things in my computer, even trying to migrate some components at Gumtree. Shiny new thing and all that. The outcome wasn&#x27;t one I enjoyed: lots of issues and nothing fully working, plus the realisation that I&#x27;m a horrible sysadmin and, although I enjoy the theory of putting servers together, I&#x27;d rather focus on developing the app and let someone else manage all the other stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I ever build a sizeable app I&#x27;d go back to Heroku . With that in my mind the announcement of Docker for Heroku really picked my interest. Thus, this post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, boring interlude is over, let&#x27;s hack!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#set-up&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: set-up&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Set up&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;getting-started-with-scala-and-heroku-local-docker-development&quot;&gt;docker in Heroku&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are missing some crucial info: you need to install both Docker and a specific plugin in your machine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m using Linux Mint, based on Ubuntu. Installing Docker &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;installation&#x2F;ubuntulinux&#x2F;&quot;&gt;seems easy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; until you hit this error when trying to run it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;FATA[0000] Get http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;var&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;docker.sock&amp;#x2F;v1.17&amp;#x2F;version: dial unix &amp;#x2F;var&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;docker.sock:
no such file or directory.
Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, StackOverflow to the rescue. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;29294286&#x2F;fata0000-get-http-var-run-docker-sock-v1-17-version-dial-unix-var-run-doc&quot;&gt;first answer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; fixed the issue for me. If you see the same error and you are not using Ubuntu or a derivative Google the error, there&#x27;s a lot of information about it. Such a common error and no steps to avoid it in the installation document... &lt;em&gt;ouch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find how to install the plugin for Heroku &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;introduction-local-development-with-docker?preview=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Run the following to ensure all is working as expected:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ heroku help docker
Usage: heroku docker
  Use Docker to build and deploy Heroku apps
[...]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-the-app&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#running-the-app&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: running-the-app&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Running the app&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Docker and the plugin working, just follow &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;getting-started-with-scala-and-heroku-local-docker-development&quot;&gt;the steps&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. A quick summary of the relevant commands follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ git clone https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;heroku&amp;#x2F;scala-getting-started.git
$ cd scala-getting-started
$ sbt stage                 # let&amp;#x27;s build the code
$ heroku docker:init        # create dockerfile
$ heroku docker:start       # run the app. You may or may not need sudo for this
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will generate a local &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;builder&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and run the app. The Dockerfile generated is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;FROM heroku&amp;#x2F;cedar:14

RUN echo &amp;quot;export JAVA_HOME=\&amp;quot;&amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;heroku&amp;#x2F;jdk&amp;quot; &amp;gt; &amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;.profile.d&amp;#x2F;jdk.sh
RUN echo &amp;quot;export PATH=\&amp;quot;&amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;heroku&amp;#x2F;jdk&amp;#x2F;bin:\$PATH&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;.profile.d&amp;#x2F;jdk.sh

ONBUILD COPY target &amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;target

ONBUILD USER root
ONBUILD RUN chown -R app &amp;#x2F;app&amp;#x2F;target
ONBUILD USER app

ONBUILD EXPOSE 3000
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the file is just setting the environment: open ports, install JDK, etc. The relevant part is the series of &lt;em&gt;ONBUILD&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; actions at the end. They are the ones copying the contents of our &lt;em&gt;target&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; folder as the app to run and exposing the port used to connect to it. But the fact they are &lt;em&gt;ONBUILD&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; means this image will be extended by another Dockerfile, as otherwise they would not be executed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, indeed, if you look at the output of &lt;em&gt;docker:start&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;Step 16 : ONBUILD expose 3000

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that &lt;code&gt;FROM heroku-docker-ef389ffce157641fd8a8a903641ab592&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;? A bit of magic in here, but we will allow it as it is the point of Heroku: devops as a  black box. In any case, time to go to production:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ heroku create
$ heroku docker:release
$ heroku open
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new image is built (you can see the triggers being actioned again) and the locally generated slug is uploaded to Heroku, a total of 63MB of a maximum allowed of 300Mb. The app works as expected, all good. A very similar experience to what you expect with the standard Heroku process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;concerns&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#concerns&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: concerns&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Concerns&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Docker within Heroku makes me uneasy. I like Docker, but I see this integration as trying to marry two contradicting approaches. Docker requires you to know what are you doing, you can hack it blissfully ignorant but then it hits back with a dose of reality and a pile of errors. Heroku, on the other hand, is a fire-and-forget heaven for developers: care about the services, not about how are they being run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the tools Heroku provides hide this pain as the Dockerfile is built for you and it is a very basic Dockerfile. But then, is it necessary? And is it a complete abstraction?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I built my app for either local or remote deployment, the build process happened locally in my machine. The issue here is that the base image (the Dockerfile generated) is not rebuild, there is no need as the key steps are triggers (ONBUILD) that will be run later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I may be missing something obvious as I&#x27;m not an expert, but as far as I understand this means that if the &lt;em&gt;cedar-14&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; base image contains a component with a serious vulnerability, unless I wipe all the local caches from my system (for both &lt;em&gt;cedar-14&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and my app) my built slug will contain that vulnerability. Obviously I don&#x27;t know which magic happens inside the Dockerfile used by Heroku that extends mine, but that doesn&#x27;t ease my concerns at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems by trying to adopt a new technology now the developer needs to worry a bit more about sysadmin things. And also, not critical but still relevant, we need to upload the locally-built slug to the system. This can be up to 300Mb, which kind of defeats the speed increase of doing the build process in your beefy machine. Asymmetric connections are still the norm, unfortunately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I get why is Heroku trying to do this, but I&#x27;m not sure it has any real benefit as unfortunately not all developers may realise some implications. Or maybe that&#x27;s the point: get people on-board via Docker and then show them a simpler and maybe safer way, the old and tested one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; As I mentioned above, I received an email from Michael Friss (from Heroku) about the concerns I had. I feel they address the issues and it is fair to mention it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stack concerns are valid and interesting, so I want to address them in detail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku docker:release&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; does not (currently) release the entire heroku&#x2F;cedar:14 that you created locally. It only extracts the &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;app&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; contents and packages that into a slug (containing a JVM, your packages and your app) that&#x27;s released to Heroku. That&#x27;s deployed to the same Heroku runtime stack as slugs from normal buildpacks, and we keep that patched and updated. We also keep the &lt;code&gt;heroku&#x2F;cedar:14&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; image updated on Docker-hub for you to pull.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we make progress on the Docker-stuff, and if it graduates out of beta, we&#x27;ll build supported and hands-off flows similar to how the Heroku-supported buildpacks work. (We&#x27;ll probably also rely more on Buildpacks to make the Docker-flow work. Check out how Python works right now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;heroku&#x2F;heroku-docker&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;python&#x2F;Dockerfile.t#L31&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;re correct that there&#x27;s ALSO an option to break out of the supported flow and tweak the Dockerfile. This has roughly the same semantics as forking a Heroku buildpack or creating a buildpack from scratch. Something that 1000s of Heroku users do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all. As always, feedback via Twitter&#x2F;Email is more than welcome. Cheers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a weekend wasted in bed (food poisoning sucks) I&#x27;ve spent some hours catching up with tech news. And I&#x27;ve found a very interesting, if brief, comment about a new war between Apple and Google that may impact their success in wearables.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;5&#x2F;1&#x2F;stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability-for-may-1st-2015.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; you may notice something very relevant in the way Apple and Google are managing their ecosystem. I am talking about this fragment:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A telling difference between Google and Apple: Google Now becomes a more robust platform with 70 new partner apps. Apple takes an app-centric view of the world and Google not  surprisingly takes a data centric view. With Google developers feed Google data for Google to display. With Apple developers feed Apple apps for users to consume. On Apple developers push their own brand and control functionality through bundled extensions, but Google will have the perspective to really let their deep learning prowess sing. So there&#x27;s a real choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m aware that at first glance this seems a minor difference, just the standard approach both companies have when treating their apps and their ecosystem. But this week brings some additional context: you may have noticed Twitter swamped by images of people showing off their Apple watches. And, in that context, this difference in approach becomes much more relevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s assume that wearables are here to stay. One of their selling points is to streamline your access to app notifications, making it easier to act on them. On the other hand, you don&#x27;t want to get swamped by alerts as they become distracting and may drain the battery too fast. Thus, you expect only relevant alerts to appear in your fancy watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here comes the big difference in approach: with Apple you relay on developers behaving nicely and not swamping the user with notifications. You expect them apps to be smart and show only what&#x27;s relevant. This may require each app to learn about each user&#x27;s preferences, which in the current era of machine learning is not hard, but it means each app needs to do this. And I won&#x27;t comment on expecting apps not to spam you, we all have our experiences on that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#x27;s approach (unless misunderstood) seems to be radically different: let&#x27;s remove the burden of learning about user preferences from the app, we will take care of that via Google Now. You just send us the data and we will send the relevant alerts. The impact for developers is massive: you don&#x27;t need to develop your own machine learning process, you can rely on Google&#x27;s far superior pool of data and expertise. And you don&#x27;t have to be worried about how many notifications are too many, Google will adjust that by tailoring notifications, taking decisions based on data that is not available to you but to which they have access, due to aggregation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say we are in the deep learning era, where personalisation is the key for success, and this includes not only your experience with an individual app but also your experience with a device in itself. I feel Google&#x27;s approach is a winner. It allows developers to stop worrying about notifications and how relevant are they, and focus on the app itself. At the same time the user will get a very streamlined experience, with relevant notifications at relevant times. I wonder if Apple needs to revisit their philosophy in this area.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say &#x27;kinda&#x27; is because the last lesson consists on a relatively big project (classifying tweets) which I will skip. It can be quite time consuming and I feel after the previous lessons I understand the concepts behind Storm well enough. I believe that, even if I spend now a few evenings doing this project, I will forget stuff from lack of use of Storm after it. Thus, it feels a better investment of my time to focus on other areas right now and put that effort whenever I need to use Storm for something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the course was very useful. I liked the format, and it gave me a good library of examples I stored in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;udacity-storm&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and can be used in the future to refresh my memory. A tip: if you do the course, don&#x27;t skip the interviews at the end of lesson 4. They have some nice insights.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think that most software developers have a secret desire: to build their own game. Unfortunately the golden times of the 80&#x27;s where simplistic games with almost no graphics succeeded are gone. Music, graphics, story... nowadays a decent game requires lots of manpower. But is that dream over?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately technology advances fast. Very fast. If the complexity of games has increased, so has the capabilities of game development tools. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unity3d.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Unity3D&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a game engine used by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unity3d.com&#x2F;showcase&#x2F;gallery&quot;&gt;plenty&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of successful games that streamlines the process to a huge degree. No, a single developer won&#x27;t build the next &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clashofclans.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but it&#x27;s much easier for a small team to do so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried Unity a few years ago (when Unity 3.x was offered for free) but, somehow, I never spent much time to it. I forgot about it until recently, when I ended up with a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLREdURb87ks2qkD9svvlIwYwN35FZ3Afv&amp;amp;app=desktop&quot;&gt;very good tutorial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (warning: it&#x27;s in Spanish) and I decided I&#x27;d implement something by following it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, indeed, I did. I started yesterday morning and in less than 48 hours my game is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.araconsoftware.rundemo&quot;&gt;available&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the Google Play store. Granted: it&#x27;s buggy, not original and very silly. But I built it, so I&#x27;ll overlook all those truths for a while if you don&#x27;t mind me doing so. It&#x27;s my baby-game ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also uploaded the source to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;run-unity3d-game-sample&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I deviated a bit from the tutorial (nothing major), so feel free to use it as a template to experiment with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean I&#x27;ll drop everything and become a game developer? Not really. But I may start devoting more time doing things like this, as it was extremely fun. Maybe after I finish with the Machine Learning courses, and testing Akka Http, and Akka Streams, and... well, you get the idea ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

At this stage I should be able to understand how Sprouts and Bolts interact, and to parse data from Twitter in real time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting lesson. I like a lot the fact that you have videos explaining what to do, then a text document describing steps, followed by a video with the solution. It makes it easy to go through the course, and if you are tight on time you can skip the first video (and go back to it if you get stuck).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the use of Twitter data very interesting, seeing all that data coming to you in real time... wow. The only downside is that the server (run in your localhost) to visualise the results was dying under the pressure. The fans of my MacBook Pro were spinning like crazy, but the server couldn&#x27;t handle the sheer amount of data. Oh, well, lesson learned!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest I have the feeling my solutions for exercise 6 and 7 may not be correct, but due to the visualisation problem mentioned above I can&#x27;t verify if that&#x27;s the case. I&#x27;m not too worried, though, as the aim of this lesson is to understand the concepts behind connecting Sprouts and Bolts, which I did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my solutions to this lesson in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;udacity-storm&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And more work in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Data_science&quot;&gt;data science&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; world. I&#x27;ve joined yet another &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; class: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;ml-008&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Yes, I might be overdoing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest this is a class I started time ago but I had to drop due to lack of time. So it was great news to realise that it was running again, just when I want to focus on this area. The videos are very helpful and after doing the first practical exercise I&#x27;m very happy as the hands-on experience allows you to play around and imagine areas in which you could already apply this. Very motivating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the lessons about Octave proved beneficial as it facilitated solving the exercises in the other class I&#x27;m taking, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;mmds-002&quot;&gt;Mining Massive Datasets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As I wrote in my last post, I wasn&#x27;t sure if to continue that class as I didn&#x27;t want to spend hours doing matrix calculations by hand (laziness, or maybe just trying to be more efficient). Octave solved that by letting me automate the process. A win - win situation!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d love to publish the code in Octave, but unfortunately this goes against the Code of Honour, so... maybe another time :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of my efforts to understand more of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Data_science&quot;&gt;data science&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; world, I&#x27;ve joined another &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; class: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;mmds-002&quot;&gt;Mining Massive Datasets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. First week done, how was it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that, unfortunately, I found it discouraging for a developer. Don&#x27;t take me wrong, the course is fine and plenty of developers will love it. But my maths are &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; rusty, it&#x27;s been a long time since I had to do things like multiplying matrixes. So the first week has been harder than expected: I can calculate your &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MapReduce&quot;&gt;MapReduce&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solutions with little effort, but iterating over PageRank...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that, personally, I like more a &#x27;hands-on&#x27; approach and the fact this course is so theoretical puts me off a bit. One gets used to a quick-feedback loop during development and moving to the pure-theory realm is hard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I understand all the course will follow the same pattern (videos and quiz) with some coding exercises as &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; deliverables with no impact in your grade. I doubt many people attend a MOOC for the grade (at least if you are taking the free ones) so most of the effort in the course will be to understand purely theoretical approaches. I&#x27;m not denying their usefulness, but given my limited free time I may have to drop this course if things keep at the same level, as at my current level of data science knowledge I won&#x27;t benefit too much from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

There is a lot of truth in this but if we think about it a bit more it feels that, nowadays, the way this is happening is via machine learning and analytics. These are the tools that can move personalization to the next level and, with it, changing the way services interact with customers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is just to justify why I&#x27;ve started the first lesson of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;ud381&quot;&gt;Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a free &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; course. Recently I&#x27;ve tried to narrow down things I do to a few relevant ones, instead of being too spread out into many unrelated tasks. And, as I wrote at the start of the post, I truly believe real-time analytics is the next big software revolution (well, arguably is already ongoing, not that I&#x27;m a visionary of any kind) so, as a developer, any effort on it is worth the time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how was it? The course has 4 lessons and today I&#x27;ve finished the first one. This is an introductory lesson in which you set up your environment and you learn some of the pitfalls of real-time analytics along what&#x27;s the role of Storm in this field.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code wise you have some very simple problems in which you modify existing topologies, but I feel these basic exercises help you getting familiar with Storm&#x27;s architecture. Judging by the advice and some of the steps required, the lessons are aimed to people with minimal knowledge of Java and Maven but that&#x27;s not bad (you will do that part faster if you know them).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting to see how the second lesson works out for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my solutions in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;udacity-storm&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one, which has got quite a lot of traction, is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@GumtreeDevTeam&#x2F;the-end-of-orm-dc0540008b23&quot;&gt;The end of ORM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where I talk about how Akka persistence may be the solution for the headaches ORM cause.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, split in two parts, is a summary of the talks in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactconf.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;React.conf 2014&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I was very lucky to attend that event, and I posted the notes I took on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@GumtreeDevTeam&#x2F;react-conf-day-1-a929d3b6e9b0&quot;&gt;day 1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@GumtreeDevTeam&#x2F;react-conf-day-2-fcbe386ea776&quot;&gt;day 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.

To that aim we have spent some weeks building tools and scaffolding that will facilitate our next tasks. Planning is important if you want quality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that for this particular project we are using &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.spring.io&#x2F;spring&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;spring-framework-reference&#x2F;html&#x2F;mvc.html&quot;&gt;Spring MVC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we wanted a way to build our model objects without duplication and to keep things in sync with minimal effort. The builder pattern is a fit, but adding inheritance makes things much more complex than they seem at first glance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve written about it in a post in our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@GumtreeDevTeam&#x2F;builder-pattern-and-inheritance-in-java-25ccd2d70c9d&quot;&gt;Gumtree dev blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where you can find some code samples along the explanation of the issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Raspberry Pi as NAS with Samba</title>
        <published>2014-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published>

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/raspberry-pi-as-nas-with-samba/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year I&#x27;ve bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&#x27;ve wanted to play with it for a long time, but it was one of these things you keep delaying as I wasn&#x27;t sure what to use it for. After moving to London, and given that my NAS died, I found myself in need of a replacement, one that allowed me to install &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.code42.com&#x2F;crashplan&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Crashplan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on it if possible (for cloud backup).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commercial NAS unit was a no go even if they had support for Crashplan: they are quite expensive and my experience with Lacie units has not been the best. Having a desktop on 24&#x2F;7 to manage backups would allow me to install Crashplan on it, but it seemed a waste of cpu and electricity. And here is when Raspberry Pi came to save the day: it can be used as a low power PC, but it has enough RAM and CPU to work as NAS and provide some other services. Low power consumption (some estimates are £5-10 per year) and my files are safe. Success!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this I have my Raspberry Pi connected to 1 Tb storage, using &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samba.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Samba&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to allow access to the files across the network and backing up all my data via Crashplan. It can even serve videos to my TV via &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dlna.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DLNA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It is not complex to do, but it required browsing a few articles online and putting together some information. In this post I summarise the steps on how to achieve this. I apologise in advance as the post has no images, which makes it a bit dry, but hopefully it is easy to follow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#requirements&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: requirements&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Requirements&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow these steps you need:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi B with 8 Gb SD card. Take the B model as it has 512Mb of RAM (and you WILL need them). Also buy the SD card they sell, as it has the default operating system (Raspbian) preloaded. It saves time and problems.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seagate Backup Plus (1 Tb). This hard drive doesn&#x27;t require an external power cable, it only uses 1 USB cable to connect it to the Raspberry unit, which makes it convenient.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power supply for Raspberry Pi. They sell one in their shop, but you can also use any mini USB power supply you have that follows their specifications.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HDMI cable. To connect Raspberry Pi to a monitor during the initial setup.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB keyboard. For the first configuration steps.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network cable. You will have one USB port taken by the HD, so it&#x27;s better to keep the other free for a keyboard and connect the Raspberry to the network by cable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have all the pieces, you can start. I have added references to the sources where I found how to set up the Raspberry in each section, but if you get stuck check &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;raspberrypi.stackexchange.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as they have a forum dedicated to Raspberry with a lot of useful information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;setup-of-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#setup-of-raspberry-pi&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: setup-of-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Setup of Raspberry Pi&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raspberry has a helpful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;quick-start-guide-v2_1.pdf&quot;&gt;guide to set up&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the unit. If you bought the SD card with NOOBS preinstalled then you can skip the few first steps and go straight to the part talking about the first boot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, select Raspbian (the recommended OS for Raspberry, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based) and wait for it to be installed. It will take a while. Then you will be prompted to restart the unit. After rebooting Raspbian will automatically load a configuration menu, in which we will tweak some options:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 1, expand filesystem. It is not needed in NOOBS but run it just in case&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 2, set a new password for the user pi. Given that we will log via ssh, you need this&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 8, in advanced options make sure that ssh is enabled. I also overclocked the unit (middle option) as it will be running quite a few services.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are done, exit and reboot the unit. Then log into it and install &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Avahi_(software)&quot;&gt;avahi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow us to ssh to the Raspberry via the hostname &lt;em&gt;raspberrypi.local&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, removing the need to keep track of its ip. Once installed, reboot again the unit and try to log into it via ssh:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the recommended way to connect to the Raspberry Pi. You can remove the HDMI cable and the keyboard from the unit and use ssh from now on to operate on it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;138281&#x2F;the-htg-guide-to-getting-started-with-raspberry-pi&#x2F;&quot;&gt;another guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that can help you by covering areas that may not be clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;raspberry-as-nas&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#raspberry-as-nas&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: raspberry-as-nas&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Raspberry as NAS&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting our Raspberry Pi, we will turn it into a NAS system using Samba, so we can copy files across the network. This requires the external HD to be connected to the unit. There are a couple of step by step &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;139433&#x2F;how-to-turn-a-raspberry-pi-into-a-low-power-network-storage-device&#x2F;&quot;&gt;guides&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makeuseof.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-nas-box&#x2F;&quot;&gt;available&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which can help you through the process. The guides also mention how to use a second hard drive for local data redundancy. I only use one HD by now, but it can be a recommended step to ensure you don&#x27;t lose data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the guides, the HD is left in NTFS. It is slower than EXT4, but allows us to connect it to a Windows machine directly in case of need. To be able to use that filesystem we need some extra packages, installed via:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mounting-the-hd&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#mounting-the-hd&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: mounting-the-hd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Mounting the HD&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The external hard drive (if you only use one) will be recognised as &lt;strong&gt;&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda1&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; by Raspbian. We need to mount it permanently in our filesystem. I chose to mount it in the folder &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;media&#x2F;hd1&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, by doing the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo mkdir &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1
sudo mount -t auto &amp;#x2F;dev&amp;#x2F;sda1 &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates the folder, and mounts the external HD into it. We now need to tell the system to mount the unit every time it boots. Edit &lt;em&gt;fstab&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo nano &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;fstab
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and add the following line at the bottom:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x2F;dev&amp;#x2F;sda1 &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1 auto noatime 0 0
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and you can restart the Raspberry Pi to check that the disk is mounted at &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;media&#x2F;hd1&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;samba&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#samba&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: samba&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Samba&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a specific folder in the HD for our Samba share, so we can isolate the shared folder from other files we may want to store in the disk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo mkdir &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;share
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Samba, do a backup of the default configuration and edit it by running:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
sudo cp &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;samba&amp;#x2F;smb.conf &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;samba&amp;#x2F;smb.conf.old
sudo nano &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;samba&amp;#x2F;smb.conf
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the config file, uncomment the line:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;security = user
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and add at the bottom of the file:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Share]
comment = My share
path = &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;share
valid users = @users
force group = users
create mask = 0660
directory mask = 0771
read only = no
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took a page of this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calomel.org&#x2F;samba_optimize.html&quot;&gt;guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on optimising Samba and replaced the &lt;em&gt;socket options&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in the file by:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_RCVBUF=65536 SO_SNDBUF=65536
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the aim of improving performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is creating a user that can access the share when connecting via the network. I created a user called &lt;em&gt;nas&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, typing the password I chose when prompted:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;useradd nas -m -G users
passwd nas
smbpasswd -a nas
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart Samba:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;service samba restart
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you should be able to access the share in your network by using the user &lt;em&gt;nas&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and its credentials.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;crashplan&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#crashplan&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: crashplan&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Crashplan&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crashplan is my tool of choice for remote backups, sending the data in our NAS to the cloud. We will run it as a headless client, which means that we run the service in Raspberry but the client, which we use to configure the backup options, runs in another computer and connects via the network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service is a Java application, which means that we have to install the &lt;em&gt;jvm&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; into Raspberry Pi. Given that the Oracle implementation is much better than the OpenJDK one, the first step is to purge OpenJDK and install Oracle&#x27;s Java, ensuring it is the default choice in the system:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\* icedtea-\* icedtea6-\*
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk
sudo update-alternatives --list java
sudo update-alternatives —config java
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we can follow the steps in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bionoren.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;raspberry-pi-crashplan&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to install Crashplan in our Raspberry.  The guide also install Java 8, we skip that and go straight to point 8. I summarise the steps in here as a quick reference.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crashplan.com&#x2F;consumer&#x2F;download.html?os=Linux&quot;&gt;Download&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Crashplan for Linux, copy it to the Raspberry (via scp) and extract it there. Then run the installer:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo Crashplan-install&amp;#x2F;install.sh
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept the license and select the default locations for the installation. Then you need to patch &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jonrogers.co.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;libjtux.so&quot;&gt;libjtux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jonrogers.co.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;libmd5.so&quot;&gt;md5 library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by downloading the linked files and copying them to &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;crashplan&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to install &lt;em&gt;libjna&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for Java:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libjna-java
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done, edit &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;crashplan&#x2F;bin&#x2F;CrashPlanEngine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and find the line that begins with &lt;em&gt;FULL_CP=&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, around the start case, and edit it so it looks like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FULL_CP=&amp;quot;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;share&amp;#x2F;java&amp;#x2F;jna.jar:$TARGETDIR&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;com.backup42.desktop.jar:$TARGETDIR&amp;#x2F;lang&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to run the Crashplan engine at boot time by editing &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and adding on the line above &lt;em&gt;exit 0&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;local&amp;#x2F;crashplan&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;CrashPlanEngine start
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the unit and if everything worked when you run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;local&amp;#x2F;crashplan&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;CrashPlanEngine status
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you should see the service is running.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bionoren.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;raspberry-pi-crashplan&#x2F;#comment-97&quot;&gt;a comment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the above guide that shows how to modify the swap to point to another file. There are two good reasons for this. First of all, the default swap in Raspberry is not much, and Raspbian may kill processes heavy in RAM when running low on memory, increasing the swap will avoid it killing Crashplan on a whim. Secondly, Java may do heavy use of the swap and thus shorten the life of the SD card by doing many writes to it, which we can fix by moving the swap to our external disk. I created a swap file in the external hd by following the instructions:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd if=&amp;#x2F;dev&amp;#x2F;zero of=&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;swapfile bs=1M count=1024
mkswap &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;swapfile
chown root:root &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;swapfile
chmod 0600 &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;swapfile
swapon &amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;swapfile
sudo apt-get purge dphys-swapfile
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we apply this change on each boot by editing &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;fstab&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and adding to the bottom (to ensure the disk that contains the swap is mounted first):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the Raspberry and execute &lt;em&gt;free&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. You should see a swap of 1Gb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t enter into detail on how to connect a headless client as the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.code42.com&#x2F;CrashPlan&#x2F;Latest&#x2F;Configuring&#x2F;Configuring_A_Headless_Client&quot;&gt;official guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; explains it perfectly. Just remember that you will need to run the tunnel every time you connect via the client, and the tunnels timeout from time to time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now configure Crashplan to backup the files in &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;media&#x2F;hd1&#x2F;share&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to their cloud and you are done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an optional last step you can follow. The settings above should ensure that Crashplan is not killed by Raspbian, but this may happen. To fix this without us having to ssh into the box every day, I&#x27;ve added a &lt;em&gt;cronjob&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that restarts the Raspberry every day at 2 am. If you are not a &lt;em&gt;crontab&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; expert you can see how to do this &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;raspberrypi.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2150&#x2F;how-do-i-reboot-at-a-specific-time&quot;&gt;in this stack exchange&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; question, just replace the &lt;em&gt;0,8&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by a &lt;em&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In my case 2am is not a time when I will be using the NAS, so a restart should not be an issue and it will ensure that any services that were killed are restarted accordingly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;torrents&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#torrents&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: torrents&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Torrents&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a NAS backed up in the cloud. Given that it will be running 24&#x2F;7, we can try to squeeze it a bit more by adding a torrent client to the box. That way you can download you latest Linux distro without having to keep your desktop on all night, Raspberry rakes care about it. There is a guide on how to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;142044&#x2F;how-to-turn-a-raspberry-pi-into-an-always-on-bittorrent-box&#x2F;&quot;&gt;install deluge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a headless server, which we can then access via a remote client or a web interface.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we install &lt;em&gt;deluged&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and we run it so it creates the default config files:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install deluged
sudo apt-get install deluge-console
deluged
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait for a couple of minutes so all the files are created, and then kill the process:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo pkill deluged
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we backup the authentication file and edit it to add a new user:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cp ~&amp;#x2F;.config&amp;#x2F;deluge&amp;#x2F;auth ~&amp;#x2F;.config&amp;#x2F;deluge&amp;#x2F;auth.old
nano ~&amp;#x2F;.config&amp;#x2F;deluge&amp;#x2F;auth
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you can add a user in the format &lt;em&gt;user:password:10&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The user and password don&#x27;t need to match any existing user, they are the credentials you will use to remotely connect to the server via the client. Now we start the service again and we enter into the console:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;deluged
deluge-console
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the console we run the following commands to allow for remote connections to the service:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;config -s allow_remote True
config allow_remote
exit
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to apply the new configuration we restart the service:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo pkill deluged
deluged
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to run &lt;em&gt;deluged&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at boot time by editing &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and adding on the line above &lt;em&gt;exit 0&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;deluged
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t explain how to connect via the client as the guide linked above has a complete explanation, with images, and it is quite straightforward. I just recommend you to only download 1 torrent at once and to set the destination folder for all the torrents to a path inside the &lt;em&gt;samba share&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, so you can access it from the network. Just make sure Crashplan doesn&#x27;t backup that folder. As we have plenty of memory in use in this Raspberry I&#x27;ve not installed the web interface as I thought it was of little benefit and we can use that RAM for other things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;dlna&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#dlna&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: dlna&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
DLNA&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the amount of storage in the NAS, we will probably keep plenty of photos and videos in it. We can install a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dlna.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DLNA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; compliant server in our Raspberry that will index all the media files in our share and make them available to any DLNA compatible device: smartphones, laptops or TVs. We do this by installing &lt;em&gt;minidlna&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, an open source implementation of the protocol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process, taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;phpBB3&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=16352&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, is extremely simple. Be aware that the guide does many other things we already took care of, just skip them and scroll down to the part that says &lt;em&gt;install minidlna&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In your Raspberry run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install minidlna
sudo update-rc.d minidlna defaults
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this minidlna is installed and ready to run when rebooting the unit. Modify the configuration by editing &lt;em&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;minidlna.conf&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (as root). In the config, look for the following sections and update accordingly:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;media_dir=A,&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;share&amp;#x2F;Music
media_dir=V,&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;share&amp;#x2F;Video
media_dir=P,&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;share&amp;#x2F;Photos

db_dir=&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;dlna

log_dir=&amp;#x2F;media&amp;#x2F;hd1&amp;#x2F;dlna
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media folders are an example, set them accordingly as per your &lt;em&gt;share&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; folder structure. The other two entries store minidlna metadata and logs in the external hd so we have enough room for them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the service via:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo service minidlna force-reload
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wait for the service to index all the files. It is quite fast, depending on how many media files you own, but until a file is indexed you won&#x27;t be able to access it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are done, you have a NAS with full cloud backup, torrenting capabilities and that can act as a media centre and show videos or photos in your TV. Congratulations! Enjoy it as much as I do enjoy mine :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">This year I've bought a Raspberry Pi. I've wanted to play with it for a long time, but it was one of these things you keep delaying as I wasn't sure what to use it for. After moving to London, and given that my NAS died, I found myself in need of a replacement, one that allowed me to install Crashplan on it if possible (for cloud backup).

&lt;p&gt;This time the testing platform has been &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I built a prototype using Play Framework, Scala and the Twilio API to see how things work and if we could use some of them in the site. Granted, by prototype I mean 2 pages to test some calls to the API, but I guess this covers the core of Twilio, and extending it should be quite straightforward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>On Learn Startup and Personal Waste</title>

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/on-learn-startup-and-personal-waste/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theleanstartup.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a (relatively) new approach on development and innovation on software companies. An interesting and recommended reading for anyone involved in software development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is not new, the &lt;em&gt;Lean Startup&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; idea was &#x27;released&#x27; on 2011, and I had become familiar with several of the concepts explained through posts on Hacker News or other sources. Unfortunately, the summaries and excerpts that you can get online are not the same as reading the book: it contains examples and necessary context that make it much more enlightening. Given that I love to read, not purchasing the book earlier was a big mistake (lazy me!). If you are in the same situation, vague knowledge on the subject but didn&#x27;t read the book, please do yourself a favour and read it. It&#x27;s around 300 pages, it won&#x27;t take you long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I won&#x27;t make any summary on the main ideas or the content. As I said, there are plenty of summaries out there and I think by not reading the book but the excerpts, you will be missing a lot. So, why this post then? Well, the book contains many relevant ideas that &lt;em&gt;just fit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, they seem completely obvious and you wonder why you didn&#x27;t think about them before. It explains a way of working quite different from the one I&#x27;m used to, and given that my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perevillega.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;on-learn-startup-and-personal-waste&#x2F;www.gumtree.com&quot;&gt;new company&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; uses this process I have plenty of work ahead of me to adapt. But, mostly, because one concept in the book made me think about my personal workflow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about that concept: &lt;strong&gt;waste&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book spends a decent amount of time talking about waste in a company, but what about waste in our personal life? This is not a brilliant personal breakthrough, even the opposite: it is an obvious thought. It&#x27;s a popular subject online, plenty of places talk about it and there are plenty of applications out there to try to help you managing your time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even when you know about it and expect it, waste has a tendency to creep into your life and become a bad habit without you noticing it. And the problem is not the waste that we can expect and, somehow, limit: hours lost to Twitter, Youtube, Games or similar. No. As an example, the book mentions how a company can stop a production lane because it is more beneficial to solve an issue then than to keep working with it going on. Not a direct translation to personal habits, but what about &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifestyleupdated.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;eliminating-w4w-work-for-works-sake-and-an-announcement&#x2F;&quot;&gt;work for work&#x27;s sake&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Or about bad habits that may look useful but, if you look at them in detail, they are not?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try a simple exercise: take an excel spreadsheet and draw a table of 7 x 24 cells. Label the 7 rows as the days of the week and number the columns to map the hours in a day. Now, write in each cell  what you did during that hour the last week. Once you are done, count how many blank cells you have. That&#x27;s your free time. Colour it, if you want, to make it more visible. Not so much, isn&#x27;t it? Scared? Where did your time go?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicornfree.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Amy Hoy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has sent to their email subscribers some content on this subject. A collection of ideas to reduce waste on your personal life and free some time for your personal objectives. You will need to join her mailing list to see the content as I can&#x27;t link it here. And she is not the only one: methodologies like GTD exist to streamline your tasks, to optimize your &lt;em&gt;output&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and be more &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. As if.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve noticed a repeating pattern in my tasks: I build waste periodically, and I end up doing massive clean ups from time to time in which I go through my TO-DO list and start removing things. The worst part is the way the list grows. A piece of news that I can&#x27;t check at work, stored for later. A long technical talk that I intend to watch that evening but, for some reason, I end up not watching that day. Some relevant module or technology that may require a couple of hours of my time to test it. Slowly, things add up. And one day you have plenty of important tasks and many small ones that you couldn&#x27;t tackle in the past. And, after the clean up, the cycle starts again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, how easy is to identify waste before it becomes so? You have personal projects, career aspirations, a social life, a wife... It may seem obvious to keep a link to a video to check it later. Of course I should do &lt;em&gt;activity x&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, is good for this &lt;em&gt;part&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of my life. And so on. We have many facets (or we should if we want to fully enjoy life) and what is relevant to one facet may be waste to another. Prioritizing is not easy (besides the obvious ones), the hours are limited and things pile up. You don&#x27;t want to miss things. But it&#x27;s unavoidable, you&#x27;ll miss things and your acceptance of this fact is key. But it&#x27;s not easy, nor convenient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to solve this? Processes can be cumbersome and produce more waste than they save. I personally use Trello and Remember The Milk to manage my time, and they kind of work, but they are not perfect. Is this a business opportunity? Maybe. There are simple ways to do this? Maybe. But it is not simple, for sure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, interesting book and it helped me to pay more attention to my personal organization. Hopefully I&#x27;ll improve in this area, I&#x27;ll keep you posted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, feel free to send me your ideas on this issue. I&#x27;ll be glad to chat :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/enums-to-json-in-scala/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scala gives the developer the possibility of using &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;current&#x2F;index.html#scala.Enumeration&quot;&gt;Enumerations&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. If they should be used or if &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.scala-lang.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;tour&#x2F;case-classes.html&quot;&gt;Case Classes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are better is a debate I&#x27;m not going to start here. They exist and they can be used.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I mention enumerations is that in a personal project (which I hope to publish soon, but I digress) I&#x27;ve been using them inside some &lt;em&gt;case classes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In the same project I&#x27;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mandubian&#x2F;play-json-alone&quot;&gt;Play-JSON&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a standalone version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playframework.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;2.2.x&#x2F;ScalaJson&quot;&gt;Play Framework JSON libraries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which turn working with JSON into a boilerplate-free pleasure. All was grand until I added my first enumeration as a parameter in a case class. The compiler started to complain and it took me a while to find how to fix it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was provided by, who else, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;15488639&#x2F;how-to-write-readst-and-writest-in-scala-enumeration-play-framework-2-1&#x2F;15489179#15489179&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;five-years-ago-stack-overflow-launched-then-a-miracle-occurred&#x2F;&quot;&gt;in just 5 years&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has become an invaluable resource. I thought this may be useful to other people, so I created some basic sample code showing the solution to the issue and pushed it to a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;scala_enum_json&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As always, feel free to clone and comment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-issue&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The issue&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s assume we have the following code structure:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Enum sample #1
object EnumType1 extends Enumeration {
  type EnumType1 = Value

  val N = Value(&amp;quot;N&amp;quot;)
  val D = Value(&amp;quot;D&amp;quot;)
  val A = Value(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;)
  val C = Value(&amp;quot;C&amp;quot;)
  val L = Value(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
  val P = Value(&amp;quot;P&amp;quot;)
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Enum sample #2
object EnumType2 extends Enumeration {
  type EnumType2 = Value

  val OPTION_A = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_A&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_B = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_B&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_C = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_C&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_D = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_D&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_E = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_E&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_F = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_F&amp;quot;)
}

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Case class that uses enums
case class EnumCaseClass(name: String, enum1: EnumType1, enum2: EnumType2)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take advantage of &lt;em&gt;Play-JSON&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and create a companion object for our case class that will helps us serializing instances of this class from or into JSON.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;object EnumCaseClass {
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Support object to convert EnumCaseClass to Json using Play-JSON
  implicit val fmt = Json.format[EnumCaseClass]

  def fromJson(json: JsValue) = Json.fromJson[EnumCaseClass](json).get

  def toJson(enumCaseClass: EnumCaseClass) = Json.toJson(enumCaseClass)
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when compiling we will get errors due to the enumerations missing valid &lt;em&gt;Reads&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Writes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. We can test this by removing the enum parameters from the case class and replacing them by simple types as shown below. The code works and converts the case class into JSON, which proves that the issue is the enumeration type that can&#x27;t be managed by &lt;em&gt;Play-JSON&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;case class EnumCaseClass(name: String, enum1: Int, enum2: Int)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: solution&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Solution&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is, obviously, to provide &lt;em&gt;Reads&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Writes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for the enumerations. But we would like to do it in a generic way, to avoid duplication of very similar code. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;15488639&#x2F;how-to-write-readst-and-writest-in-scala-enumeration-play-framework-2-1&#x2F;15489179#15489179&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides an example of a support class that can accomplish this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;object EnumUtils {
  def enumReads[E &amp;lt;: Enumeration](enum: E): Reads[E#Value] =
    new Reads[E#Value] {
      def reads(json: JsValue): JsResult[E#Value] = json match {
        case JsString(s) =&amp;gt; {
          try {
            JsSuccess(enum.withName(s))
          } catch {
            case _: NoSuchElementException =&amp;gt;
               JsError(s&amp;quot;Enumeration expected of type: &amp;#x27;${enum.getClass}&amp;#x27;,
                      but it does not appear to contain the value: &amp;#x27;$s&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;)
          }
        }
        case _ =&amp;gt; JsError(&amp;quot;String value expected&amp;quot;)
      }
  }

  implicit def enumWrites[E &amp;lt;: Enumeration]: Writes[E#Value] =
    new Writes[E#Value] {
      def writes(v: E#Value): JsValue = JsString(v.toString)
    }

  implicit def enumFormat[E &amp;lt;: Enumeration](enum: E): Format[E#Value] = {
    Format(enumReads(enum), enumWrites)
  }
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates an object that provides generic &lt;em&gt;Reads&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Writes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Format&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; methods that can be used with any enumeration. We can use the methods in our enumerations, adding some implicit vals of type &lt;em&gt;Reads&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Writes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that will redirect the execution flow to the support object, as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;object EnumType1 extends Enumeration {
  type EnumType1 = Value

  val N = Value(&amp;quot;N&amp;quot;)
  val D = Value(&amp;quot;D&amp;quot;)
  val A = Value(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;)
  val C = Value(&amp;quot;C&amp;quot;)
  val L = Value(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
  val P = Value(&amp;quot;P&amp;quot;)

  implicit val enumReads: Reads[EnumType1] = EnumUtils.enumReads(EnumType1)

  implicit def enumWrites: Writes[EnumType1] = EnumUtils.enumWrites

}

object EnumType2 extends Enumeration {
  type EnumType2 = Value

  val OPTION_A = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_A&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_B = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_B&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_C = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_C&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_D = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_D&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_E = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_E&amp;quot;)
  val OPTION_F = Value(&amp;quot;OPTION_F&amp;quot;)

  implicit val enumReads: Reads[EnumType2] = EnumUtils.enumReads(EnumType2)

  implicit def enumWrites: Writes[EnumType2] = EnumUtils.enumWrites
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding this support object and the enumeration-specific &lt;em&gt;vals&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, we can now compile the project and serialize our &lt;em&gt;case class&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; into JSON.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;scala_enum_json&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and experiment with the code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mobile is the new king and HTML 5 allows developers to, at last, build once and run everywhere: tablets, phones, desktops...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing controversial in that sentence, but unfortunately Mobile is still &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. And even if we see again and again that we should do &lt;em&gt;mobile first&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; when building a web site, that doesn&#x27;t seem to work. At east judging by the rendering time of a normal page in my smartphone. And &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;1825005&#x2F;how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales&quot;&gt;page load time is money&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Il4swGfTOSM&quot;&gt;Breaking the 1000ms Time to Glass Mobile Barrier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an amazing video from Ilya Grigorik in which he explains how to prepare your website to it renders fast in mobile. Fast as in under 1s.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is completely worth your time, but as a kind of &lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; some of the most relevant hints in it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Render in &lt;em&gt;100ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; feels instant, &lt;em&gt;250ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the maximum for a good usability experience&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile leaves you &lt;em&gt;400-500ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for server and client processing due to network innate slowness&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means we have &lt;em&gt;100ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for server processing, &lt;em&gt;100ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for client processing and &lt;em&gt;200ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to download external resources and run javascript. Tight!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuse connections, do bulk transfers and compress data to fight the mobile network latency&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do progressive enhancement&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizing images for size is a must&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn javascript &lt;em&gt;async&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; whenever possible&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inline the critical CSS (the one to render things above the fold) and load the rest asynchronously via javascript&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize the use of javascript, don&#x27;t use any in the critical rendering path, only after loading the page&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome has a critical path explorer to highlight the fragments that block rendering&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome can also &lt;em&gt;audit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the page for unused CSS styles&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this, you can render your app &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scaladays.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ScalaDays 2013&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; happened this past June and the presentations are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parleys.com&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;Parleys&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. If you go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parleys.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;51ae1022e4b01033a7e4b6ca&#x2F;presentations&quot;&gt;ScalaDays 2013 channel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; you can see all of them, and many are completely worth your time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve taken a while to catch up with the presentations (too many things going on this summer), but one talk that I found very inspiring was the one by Rod Johnson, of Spring fame and currently in Typesafe board, about the future of Scala. The talk is called &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parleys.com&#x2F;play&#x2F;51c1ffe7e4b0d38b54f46231&#x2F;chapter0&#x2F;about&quot;&gt;Scala in 2018&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and, long as it is, I&#x27;d recommend you to watch it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk itself shows a &lt;em&gt;what-if&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; scenario in which circa 2018 Scala has become the dominating language in the enterprise market. From that starting point, Rod comments on what was necessary to achieve this, and shows the path Scala must take if we want this to become true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I liked a lot the idea about 2 tiers of Scala, one for innovation and one for enterprise. Both distributions evolving in parallel, so developers can experiment without being constrained and, once a feature is deemed useful and resilient, it can be migrated into a more stable enterprise package that follows enterprise-related restrictions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments of the video many people complain that the talk is very negative and it uses outdated examples, showing issues that have been already solved. This may be true, but they are still relevant ideas and the fact that they were solved doesn&#x27;t mean we can forget about them, otherwise we will do the same error again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this video makes me eager to contribute more to the community. I just need to find time for that :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/using-ansible-to-deploy-play-framework-apps-in-ec2-instances/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Clone &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;ansible-ec2-play&quot;&gt;Ansible for Play Framework&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to automate the task of deploying Play 2.x projects from a git repository into an EC2 instance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many developers I&#x27;m not a good sysadmin. That&#x27;s why I was happy to see the raise of PaaS like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heroku.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which facilitated deploying a webapp without having to spend time in sysadmin tasks which I didn&#x27;t know how to do correctly and which took me too much time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as with most abstractions, the PaaS environments are simple to use but also quite limited in options. Heroku offering of 512Mb per dyno plus limitations on what you can do can be a problem, and the third party addons get expensive quickly. Then you have Amazon EC2, cheaper and quite flexible, but in exchange you need a bit more of &quot;sysadmin knowledge&quot;. Not a big deal for apps like this blog, running in a Micro instance, but if your app is bigger and spans several servers, it may become time consuming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to automate the task of managing the server so I did not have to worry too much about it. I looked at both &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opscode.com&#x2F;chef&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Chef&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puppetlabs.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Puppet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but somehow I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend enough time with them. The release of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;opsworks&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Amazon OpsWorks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; raised the issue again as they don&#x27;t have a Play Framework 2 script ready out of the box, but it was hard to try to focus on that task.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it until this last weekend when I discovered, somehow, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansible.cc&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Ansible is a tool in the same category as Chef and Puppet (purists will start pointing at relevant differences here, but I only care about the fact that they automate my sysadmin tasks). For some reason Ansible seemed much simpler to understand and use, and I got hooked. Ansible Playbooks consist on a series of yaml files that declare the steps to execute, in order. Ansible itself manages the execution of the steps across servers, so you can run one script on as many servers as you need all at the same time. I won&#x27;t enter into details as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansible.cc&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has good enough documentation, but to put an example let&#x27;s see a possible Ansible Playbook to install &lt;code&gt;Authbind&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; into an EC2 instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    # Run with: ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playenv.yaml -u ubuntu
    ---
    - hosts: ec2Instance
      vars:
      - ubuntu_release: quantal

    tasks:
      - name: Install Authbind
        action: apt pkg=authbind state=latest install_recommends=yes
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the tool the task ahead was clear: my main 3 sysadmin issues with EC2 (given my current usage level) are securing the Ubuntu AMI, deploying a Play environment and deploying the app itself. With Ansible, I should be able to automate these steps so I won&#x27;t do mistakes like forgetting one step as well as reducing the time I have to spend on these tasks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#x27;t easy (as I said I&#x27;m not a sysadmin) and the scripts could be better, but I managed to create something that works: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;ansible-ec2-play&quot;&gt;Ansible for Play Framework in EC2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Instructions for execution are included in the Github repository.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 relevant scripts:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bootstrap.yaml:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; runs a series of commands to enhance security of an EC2 Ubuntu AMI. I&#x27;m not a sysadmin so some step may be wrong or incomplete, but what&#x27;s in there seems to work fine. Requires sudo privilege in the target machine to run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;playenv.yaml:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; sets some Play Framework dependencies (basically pvm and java 7) as well as Authbind so Play can use port 80 without root privileges. Requires sudo privilege in the target machine to run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deploy.yaml:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; clones a Play project from a given Git repository and deploys it on the target machine. The script assumes the repository contains a &lt;code&gt;start&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file in the format provided with the script (see &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; folder) to be able to successfully launch the app. Customise the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file as required. No sudo required, the script uses authbind to link Play to port 80. Be aware that in EC2 Micro instances this script will fail due to low memory as Linux memory manager kills the JVM when building the distributable zip for the app.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a project in Github (or any publicly available Git repository) and an EC2 instance, run the scripts through Ansible and there you go, app deployed and running!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&#x27;s all. If you see something that can be improved, please contribute with a pull request. I hope with this you can save some time on your next deployment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

As many developers I'm not a good sysadmin. That's why I was happy to see the raise of PaaS like Heroku, which facilitated deploying a webapp without having to spend time in sysadmin tasks which I didn't know how to do correctly and which took me too much time.

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/using-redis-pubsub-with-play-2-dot-1-0/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I was experimenting a bit with &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redis.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redis.io&#x2F;topics&#x2F;pubsub&quot;&gt;Publish-Subscribe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; module. The idea was to try to implement a chat with it (something I&#x27;ll need for my next project) and from all the options I evaluated this seemed the best. Loving Redis so far, whoever called it the swiss-knife of databases was completely right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to be expected with programming I had some trouble, in this scenario using Redis PubSub with Play 2.1.0 blocked the application. So I decided to publish this in case someone else has the same issue. If you don&#x27;t want to read the details just go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;play21-redis-pubsub&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and clone the source. It contains a very simple application in which Play subscribes to a Redis channel and sends messages to it via Akka actors, while using a listener to notify about reception of the same messages. The &lt;code&gt;Readme&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file gives more detail on how it works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let&#x27;s talk about Redis and the issue I had.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-redis-with-play&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#using-redis-with-play&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: using-redis-with-play&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Using Redis with Play&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Redis with Play is very straightforward. Typesafe provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typesafehub&#x2F;play-plugins&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;redis&quot;&gt;play plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to manage the interactions. The plugin is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pk11&#x2F;sedis&quot;&gt;Sedis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the Scala library for Redis, which in turn is a wrapper over &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xetorthio&#x2F;jedis&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Jedis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the most popular JVM library for Redis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing the dependencies for Play 2.1 are not working perfectly so you need to add an additional resolver to your project to be able to download all of them:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;resolvers += &amp;quot;org.sedis&amp;quot; at &amp;quot;http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;pk11-scratch.googlecode.com&amp;#x2F;svn&amp;#x2F;trunk&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but once done you can use Redis as both Cache layer and Database for Play.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#the-issue&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
The issue&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple as it is, things got a bit more complex when using PubSub. The way PubSub works with Redis is as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first of all you set a client to subscribe to a channel. The subscription call accepts a listener class that will trigger method calls as response to events in the channel (messages being passed around, etc.)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then you need clients to send messages to the channel via the &lt;code&gt;publish&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; operation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the resulting code for subscription would be something like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;pool.withJedisClient{ client =&amp;gt;
  client.subscribe(listener, CHANNEL)
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but as it happens &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a blocking call. This means that every time we execute it, a thread will be locked into receiving notifications from Redis. And the result is that Play will stop working as all threads get consumed by calls to this operation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: solution&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Play 2.1.0 introduces a new concept that solves this issue: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playframework.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;2.1.0&#x2F;ThreadPools&quot;&gt;ExecutionContexts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. An &lt;code&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is nothing more than a set of threads, independent from the ones managing the Play app itself, to be used when we have slow or blocking operations. This ensures some specialized thread takes care of that operation without impacting the performance of the application itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, as we have a blocking call, we simply want to run the &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; operation inside its own &lt;code&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which will consist on threads devoted to listening to Redis, while the standard &lt;code&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; manages other Play calls. So our code will become as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;object Contexts {
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Execution context used to avoid blocking on subscribe
  implicit val myExecutionContext: ExecutionContext =
Akka.system.dispatchers.lookup(&amp;quot;akka.actor.redis-pubsub-context&amp;quot;)
}

Future {
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; subscribe in a Future using a specific ExecutionContext
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; use Sedis pool to launch the subscribe operation
  pool.withJedisClient{ client =&amp;gt;
    client.subscribe(listener, CHANNEL)
  }
}(Contexts.myExecutionContext)
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s it. A simple way to avoid blocking operations slowing your app or consuming all the threads it needs. If you&#x27;ve had this issue this will solve it for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/executing-jasmine-tests-in-play-2-dot-0-4/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christmas&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; break is over, and on a whim I started to check &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;angularjs.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;AngularJs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. If you haven&#x27;t tested it yet, do it. I&#x27;ve toyed around  with Backbone and some other Javascript &lt;em&gt;single page app&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; frameworks, and Angular is by far the one that I liked the most. It has simplicity embedded in its core, and turning tedious tasks (as setting controllers) into something trivial makes it a pleasure to use. Simplicity. Such an important concept, and one which is seldom present in frameworks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. Back to the post. Adding Angular to a Play app is as simple as you can imagine, as in the end it&#x27;s a Javascript library. Add the Angular files, code controllers and services, put Angular templates under &lt;code&gt;public&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; so Angular can get them, and you are done.  You can see a project sample &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;play2demo-jasmine&quot;&gt;in my Github account&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Be aware the sample is very rough and has minimal functionality, the aim was to see how can they be linked, not to push Angular boundaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have a Javascript framework, and obviously we want to test it. Unfortunately the recommended way to test Angular is via &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.github.com&#x2F;jasmine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Jasmine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a Javascript BDD framework. I say unfortunately because that would mean running 2 commands for testing: one for Play tests and another for Angular tests. Or does it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is on moments like this when Open Source shows its worthiness. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guardian.co.uk&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and its Software development department, which open sources a lot of the code they create to run their online platform. A wise company, they use Scala and Play and they created &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guardian&#x2F;sbt-jasmine-plugin&quot;&gt;Sbt-Jasmine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a plugin to run Jasmine inside Sbt projects. Given that Play 2 uses Sbt, this should prove simple.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to be honest it wasn&#x27;t &lt;em&gt;so&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; simple, that&#x27;s why I decided to document it here to save time to other interested people. This assumes a working Play 2.0.4 project, should work with any 2.0.x project but can&#x27;t promise anything about 2.1 (have to test it yet)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;integrating-sbt-jasmine&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#integrating-sbt-jasmine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: integrating-sbt-jasmine&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Integrating Sbt-Jasmine&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite straightforward, you just need to follow the instructions from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guardian&#x2F;sbt-jasmine-plugin&quot;&gt;Sbt-Jasmine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page. On your project, under the &lt;code&gt;project&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; folder, create another folder named &lt;code&gt;project&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (that is, you will have &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;project&#x2F;project&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; path). Inside that new folder create a file &lt;code&gt;Plugins.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and add this code to it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
import sbt._


&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; This plugin is used to load the sbt-jasmine plugin into our project.
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; This allows us to import the SbtJasminePlugin file
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; in Build.scala, and then set the settings and configuration for Sbt-Jasmine
object Plugins extends Build {
  lazy val plugins = Project(&amp;quot;plugins&amp;quot;, file(&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;))
    .dependsOn(uri(&amp;quot;git:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;guardian&amp;#x2F;sbt-jasmine-plugin.git#0.7&amp;quot;))
}
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will load the plugin directly from Github into your project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-jasmine-as-part-of-your-test-cycle&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#adding-jasmine-as-part-of-your-test-cycle&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: adding-jasmine-as-part-of-your-test-cycle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Adding Jasmine  as part of your test cycle&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the plugin in, we want to be able to run both test types (Play and Jasmine) when executing &lt;code&gt;play test&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. To that aim we have to edit our &lt;code&gt;Build.scala&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project file to let Play know about Jasmine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step will be importing the existing Jasmine settings the sbt plugin added into the project. We can do that via the &lt;code&gt;PlayProject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;settings&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, as in &lt;code&gt;.settings(jasmineSettings : _*)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is to override the default Jasmine configuration, specifically the paths that point to the test assets and source files. Sbt-Jasmine expects a set of default paths that don&#x27;t map to the ones existing in a Play project, so we change them as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; jasmine configuration, overridden as we don&amp;#x27;t follow the default
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; project structure sbt-jasmine expects

appJsDir &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;app&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;javascripts&amp;quot;,
appJsLibDir &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;public&amp;#x2F;javascripts&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;quot;,
jasmineTestDir &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;test&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;&amp;quot;,
jasmineConfFile &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;test&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;test.dependencies.js&amp;quot;,

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;appJsDir&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is pointing to the folder for minimized assets, we could change that to point to &lt;code&gt;&quot;public&#x2F;Javascripts&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The paths for &lt;code&gt;appJsLibDir&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jasmineTestDir&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jasmineConfFile&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; can be modified as it suits you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jasmine configuration file follows standard Jasmine notation, which I won&#x27;t discuss in this post. The configuration for this sample project is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Dependencies for the unit test via Jasmine
EnvJasmine.loadGlobal(EnvJasmine.libDir + &amp;quot;jquery-1.8.3.min.js&amp;quot;);
EnvJasmine.loadGlobal(EnvJasmine.libDir + &amp;quot;angular.min.js&amp;quot;);
EnvJasmine.loadGlobal(EnvJasmine.libDir + &amp;quot;angular-resource.min.js&amp;quot;);
EnvJasmine.loadGlobal(EnvJasmine.testDir + &amp;quot;config&amp;#x2F;angular-mocks.js&amp;quot;);

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Import all modules (RequireJs fails for some reason)
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; FIXME: check why we can&amp;#x27;t use RequireJs
EnvJasmine.loadGlobal(EnvJasmine.rootDir + &amp;quot;todo.js&amp;quot;);

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we need to tell Play to run Jasmine tests when executing the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command. We do this by adding a dependency on &lt;code&gt;test&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with  &lt;code&gt;(test in Test) &amp;lt;&amp;lt;= (test in Test) dependsOn (jasmine)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. This will cause Play to run first the Jasmine tests and, if they succeed, Play own tests will be executed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final code looks like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;scala&quot; class=&quot;language-scala &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot; data-lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion,
 appDependencies, mainLang = SCALA)
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;this adds jasmine settings from the sbt-jasmine plugin into the project
.settings(jasmineSettings : _*)
.settings(

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Add your own project settings here

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; jasmine configuration overridden
  appJsDir &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;app&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;javascripts&amp;quot;,
  appJsLibDir &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;public&amp;#x2F;javascripts&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;quot;,
  jasmineTestDir &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;test&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;&amp;quot;,
  jasmineConfFile &amp;lt;+= baseDirectory &amp;#x2F; &amp;quot;test&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;test.dependencies.js&amp;quot;,

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; link jasmine to the standard &amp;#x27;sbt test&amp;#x27; action.
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Now when running &amp;#x27;test&amp;#x27; jasmine tests will be run
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; and after that other Play tests will be executed.
  (test in Test) &amp;lt;&amp;lt;= (test in Test) dependsOn (jasmine)
)

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s all. If you add some Jasmine tests under &lt;code&gt;test&#x2F;assets&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and then execute &lt;code&gt;play test&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; you will see them being run. Remember what I said about simplicity? Why should you remember to run 2 suits independently when 1 command can do that for you?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-be-improved&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#to-be-improved&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: to-be-improved&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
To be improved&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I would like, this is not perfect. I found a couple of issues when integrating Jasmine and Play. Given I&#x27;m not an expert on neither, any help will be appreciated:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory you could use &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;requirejs.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;RequireJS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to import the Javascript sources to test, but it didn&#x27;t work when I tried. Not sure why and for a standard AngularJs distribution we are talking about 5 Javascript files (it could grow if you break them into components), so it doesn&#x27;t seem such a big deal. But it&#x27;s not perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AngularJs allows you to declare End to End test scenarios, similar to Selenium but inside AngularJs itself. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t make them work, as they require a server running. Given the enhanced Selenium support in newer AngularJS versions I expect one could use Play end to end scenarios to test this part, but I need to put more work on it to ensure it is true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Christmas break is over, and on a whim I started to check AngularJs. If you haven't tested it yet, do it. I've toyed around  with Backbone and some other Javascript single page app frameworks, and Angular is by far the one that I liked the most. It has simplicity embedded in its core, and turning tedious tasks (as setting controllers) into something trivial makes it a pleasure to use. Simplicity. Such an important concept, and one which is seldom present in frameworks.

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From time to time I like to test some new functionality of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playframework.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Play 2.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Creating a tiny for-fun project allows me to see that functionality in action, to solve the initial pitfalls related to it and to have a basic sample for later on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Play 2.1 coming closer, and seeing all the new stuff in it (Slick, Scala 2.10, etc) I wanted to test some of the features that I&#x27;ve not been able to use in a &quot;real project&quot;, especially the ones related to Real Time web. When thinking about what to implement I remembered an issue a friend had in his company, an ETL-like process that had to receive data (massive amounts) on one end and store it in several location after processing the data. While not in the mood to create a real system which would be quite complex, having to manage queues and ensuring messages were delivered, that inspired me to plan a minor project in which I could use several interesting technologies: Iteratee, MongoDB, Redis and Akka actors. I&#x27;ve not used any of them very often, so I was sold to the idea :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the code resulting from this experiment in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;iteratees-test&quot;&gt;my Github repository&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t start a line-by-line description of the project, the source is there and I believe it&#x27;s quite self-explanatory. But there are some things that are worth mentioning, even if it is just for future reference:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enumerator.imperative&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; allows you to push data into the Enumerator manually &lt;strong&gt;and won&#x27;t close the stream&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; until you say so. I had problems when trying to implement a Html view on the stream, as a non-imperative stream was closing automatically once the data was consumed, not waiting for the next input which was slower than the rate at which the app consumed the Enumerator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.w3.org&#x2F;html5&#x2F;eventsource&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SSE&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is great, very performing and with better support than WebSockets. Also, the fact that the browser automatically restores the connection if the link is dropped simplifies the code a lot. But (always a but!) it has a bug in its implementation in Play 2.0.4 where the events won&#x27;t have an Id associated even if you provide the corresponding extractor. Hopefully that will be solved in 2.1. The event name part works, though!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concurrent.hub&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; has a nice trick with the &lt;code&gt;getPatchCord&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method where you multiplex the stream to several clients at the same time. Saves a lot of memory and CPU.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Akka&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; actors are as simple, fast and reliable as always. As a &lt;em&gt;veteran&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Java developer, seeing Actors makes it very very hard to go back to &lt;em&gt;synchronized&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and all that clutter&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination Iteratee + Actor + MongoDB is &lt;strong&gt;FAST&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. When running a test with simulated request every 10ms my computer (a bit old by nowadays standards) didn&#x27;t notice it at all. Low resource consumption and high speed? Go Play!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of NoSQL and in the past I read many articles which made me doubt about Mongo. Obviously, this is not a real-life system where I can&#x27;t afford to lose data, but it was refreshing to see the simplicity of the approach Mongo takes to storing and retrieving data. With &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactivemongo.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ReactiveMongo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and Play 2.1 it may be a wonderful support system for non-critical real-time data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redis&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; as a Memcached replacement is good, very good, but the additional methods provided by the API so you can use it as a &lt;em&gt;key store&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; can be a bit confusing. I can&#x27;t say which one is better (Redis or Memcached) but I&#x27;m quite impressed with Redis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much more to add. Feel free to clone the code and play with it. It&#x27;s nothing amazing as code goes, but it shows what you can achieve with just a few lines of Scala and Play :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scala is growing, a lot. The (relatively) recent &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.typesafe.com&#x2F;typesafe-announces-14m-series-b-financing&quot;&gt;investment of $14M&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the company ensures that the language will be taken care of and any remaining issues (like some necessary improvements for the IDE) tackled. Scala 2.10 is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;12797&quot;&gt;around the corner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and with it all the performance and APi improvements. And &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playframework.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is healthier than ever. Good times to be a Scala fan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big step to make Scala more popular has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;progfun-2012-001&#x2F;class&#x2F;index&quot;&gt;Functional Programming in Scala course from Coursera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For people like myself who  learned the language via some book and StackOverflow questions, it&#x27;s been a very welcomed training to ensure Scala foundations were good enough and to polish the functional approach to coding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the approach is very academic, and in fact some problems are solved in convoluted ways just to force the student to implement specific methods. But all in all the course is great. The videos from Martin are polished and the explanations well delivered. And the automatic evaluation method is a nice touch :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the course itself has served as trigger for some other interesting things:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;Dublin-Scala-users-group&#x2F;events&#x2F;80995152&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala meetup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was organized in Dublin, where we were able to chat and learn some more advanced techniques when using Scala&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found myself being able to solve problems from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aperiodic.net&#x2F;phil&#x2F;scala&#x2F;s-99&#x2F;&quot;&gt;99 Scala problems&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with less effort, which seems to point to an increase in my Scala skils (&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;scala99problems&quot;&gt;some code available at Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, will be completing it as time allows)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could convince 3 other guys from my current job to join the course. It&#x27;s very good to share and compare notes on the exercises (no copying, I swear!), makes it much easier to understand new concepts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been long since I felt so comfortable and happy when coding in a given platform or language. Not many people will read this, but if you do: try it! It&#x27;s worth the effort. With such an active community and so many companies adopting Play and Scala, it&#x27;s silly not to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all this, through the Scala course I discovered how great Coursera is as a learning platform. The downside for people addicted to learning like myself is that it could become time consuming in the near future (I joined around 20 courses for the next year) but the fact that you can resign at any time and that you may decide to not deliver the homework but still keep access the theory is of great value. It will be interesting to see if they can solve the issues around peer-grading, as they lower the value of some courses a bit. But the number of relevant subjects is incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, between Scala and Coursera (and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;play-modules&#x2F;modules.playframework.org&quot;&gt;some other projects&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) I&#x27;m keeping myself busy. But lots of fun ahead :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mobile browsing is becoming the norm. With the advent of devices like the new iPad or the Nexus 7, predictions that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aids.gov&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;mobile-internet-use-surpassing-desktop-internet-use-by-2014.html&quot;&gt;mobile will surpass desktop in 2014&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; seem wrong: it may happen &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobify.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mobile-web-growing-8-times-faster-than-web&#x2F;&quot;&gt;even earlier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I find myself, loving desktops as I do, using Internet on my mobile more and more often. That constant access to the net is so handy...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as a web developer this provides a new challenge: your site needs to work properly both in Mobile and Desktop browsers (and in all the flavours of each: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE, etc.). Not so long ago this was solved by having two versions of your site, a mobile one and the classic one, where you redirected the user to the correct one as per their browser (and the mobile site was usually a poorer experience).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the new relevance of the mobile versions of the site for the companies, that approach wasn&#x27;t sustainable. The model has evolved and currently there is a lot of buzz around two concepts that replace it: &lt;strong&gt;Mobile first&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Responsive Layouts&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive Layout&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; defines a site whose interface adapts to the size of the view-port of the client. That is, instead of redirecting the user to a version or another according to the browser used, we use CSS media queries to hide or show elements of the page according to the size of the browsing window.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we can have only one version of our web application, providing the minimal information necessary to a browser with a tiny view-port (usually mobile, but it could be a resized desktop browser) while adding more details for bigger browsers. You can see the concept in action &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattkersley.com&#x2F;responsive&#x2F;&quot;&gt;in this site&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Responsive Layout doesn&#x27;t come without its own &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netmagazine.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;five-responsive-web-design-pitfalls-avoid&quot;&gt;set of problems&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The most common one is that small browser windows usually correspond to devices with a poorer network connection when compared to desktops. While hiding elements via CSS simplifies the UX of the site, the elements are still being sent to the device which translates, in many cases, into a very slow experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile First&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a concept that tries to reduce the impact of this issue. Instead of designing a desktop site that hides elements when the browser window is smaller, we design the site for the tiniest device (mobile) and we display more elements if the view-port is bigger. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Progressive_enhancement&quot;&gt;Progressive enhancement&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; applied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of both concepts, Responsive Layout and Mobile First, allows us to create our web application once and, with a minimal extra effort, we will be able to provide a better experience to both Mobile and Desktop users. It has the additional benefit of focussing on the minimal functionality required (Mobile First) which may help to reduce clutter on some sites.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#example&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: example&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Example&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how about an example? I&#x27;ve created a very simple web application (in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playframework.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Play 2.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, obviously!) that may help to better understand the concepts behind these two trends. The source code can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;play2-responsive-sample&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Download it and I&#x27;ll be explaining the code next.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;imgposts&#x2F;responsive-desktop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop view of the example&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application has two content areas. A sidebar in the left that is only visible on a desktop environment and which loads a set of results from Google News, and a main area that contains a bit of text explaining the application plus a set of images obtained from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.gravatar.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gravatar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. There is also a colour border around the body, coloured red for a browser with a “desktop” size. Simple, but it should be enough to showcase the ideas behind the concepts discussed above.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application uses 3 different techniques to manage 3 elements of the application:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS Media Queries&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are used to select the colour of the border around the body of the page. As you resize the browser horizontally the colour should change when you cross one of the thresholds set. These thresholds are also used to show or hide the sidebar. These changes are dynamically applied when you resize the browser, but on the other hand they don&#x27;t reduce the amount of content downloaded on page request.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional load&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the contents of the sidebar. The list of news items in the sidebar are loaded via a query to Google News. As the sidebar may not be displayed in some browsers, we only execute the query when the viewport is bigger than a given value. This check only happens when we load the page, so if the content wasn&#x27;t loaded and the browser is then resized so the sidebar becomes visible, the user won&#x27;t see the news items but some default text that allows the user to access the same content by launching a Google query, so we don&#x27;t “punish” the user for resizing the browser by removing access to content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed load&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the images in the main area. We could use &lt;em&gt;img&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; tags in the page when rendering it but that would mean that the browser will have to launch multiple requests (one per image) while loading the page. With this technique we mark some anchor tags with metadata and, once the page has been loaded, we inject the img tags into the page. The images will be loaded at that point, but the site itself will be already working and the user can interact with it even in slower connections. We can also modify the size of the image we display according to the viewport so the user downloads a smaller version in devices with potentially worse connections. As with conditional load, this only works on the request, resizing the browser won&#x27;t launch the script again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what is being done, let&#x27;s go into the relevant parts of the code.
The application uses 2 templates: main.scala.html provides some common behaviour (like css and javascript files) while index.scala.html contains the relevant code of the demo. The application is using &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.github.com&#x2F;bootstrap&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Twitter Bootstrap&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the base layout. Some code (like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernizr.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Modernizr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; usage) is not explained in this post but the demo contains some comments about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable the responsive layout from Bootstrap I add in &lt;strong&gt;main.html&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will ensure that the browser doesn&#x27;t try to fake the viewport size on the request, while still allowing for zooming in mobile devices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;index.scala.html&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I declare the basic layout with the two areas of the page. I use a fluid layout from Bootstrap plus one of the responsive styles (visible-desktop) which will hide the sidebar if the browser is less than &lt;em&gt;968px&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;container-fluid&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;row-fluid&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;span2 visible-desktop&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;!-- Sidebar content --&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;div&amp;gt;

   &amp;lt;div class=”span10”&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;!-- Main content --&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;div&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;div&amp;gt;

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The styles file, &lt;strong&gt;main.css&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, contains a set of media queries that will change the border around the body of the page according to the size of the browser:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;#x2F;* Landscape phones and down *&amp;#x2F;
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    border: 2px magenta solid;
  }
}


&amp;#x2F;* Landscape phone to portrait tablet *&amp;#x2F;
@media (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    border: 2px grey solid;
  }
}


&amp;#x2F;* Portrait tablet to landscape and desktop *&amp;#x2F;
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px) {
  body {
    border: 2px blue solid;
  }
}


&amp;#x2F;* Desktop *&amp;#x2F;
@media (min-width: 979px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    border: 2px orange solid;
  }
}

&amp;#x2F;* Large desktop *&amp;#x2F;
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    border: 2px red solid;
  }
}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to here  there are elements that will be downloaded always, whatever the viewport size, and may change behaviour dynamically as you resize your browser. Many responsive layouts stop here, but if the sidebar contained a lot of data and images, that would penalize mobile users by forcing them to download extra content they&#x27;ll never see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this we add a minimal amount of content to the sidebar, so if a user resizes the browser and sees it doesn&#x27;t get a white gap with no content (progressive enhancement):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;!--Sidebar content --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Dynamic Sidebar&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  This sidebar loads a minimal amount of content by default.
  If we will display it, some ajax requests will populate it
  with extra content.
&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;hr&amp;#x2F;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;sidebar&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- We provide a link to access the data we are not loading in case
     the user resizes the screen and sees this bar --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;www.google.com&amp;#x2F;search?q=responsive+design&amp;amp;amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
Search Google on Responsive Design
&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;a&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&amp;#x2F;div&amp;gt;

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then we add some javascript magic to load the real content dynamically via Conditional Loading. In this example the content loaded is the result of a query to Google News. The details on the retrieval of the data are not relevant to this post. What&#x27;s relevant is this part of the code (excerpt):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

&amp;#x2F;* This loads the content of the side bar asynchronously,
   so we won&amp;#x27;t do that request if the sidebar won&amp;#x27;t be shown *&amp;#x2F;
$(function() {
  if ($(window).width() &amp;gt;= 979) {
    searchGoogle(&amp;#x27;responsive+design&amp;#x27;);
  }
});


&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fragment will wait until the page has been loaded (equivalent to jquery&#x27;s &lt;code&gt;$(document).ready&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; ) and then check the window size. If the size corresponds to a desktop browser (in which the Bootstrap style visible-desktop will stop hiding the sidebar) then the search is triggered and the content added to the sidebar. Otherwise nothing happens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that for a mobile user there will be no extra work done (besides a simple javascript check) as the information would not be shown, improving the loading time of the page. The fact that the check is done after the main content is ready is also relevant, as the user can start interacting with the main page immediately when in a desktop, and the additional data (which is less relevant to the user) will be loaded in the meantime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s talk now about the images displayed in the main area and Delayed Loading. In this sample  around &lt;em&gt;500 images&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are loaded at once in that section. This could be, in reality, the comments area of a popular blog with lots of comments (and their corresponding images).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the naïve approach the html would be rendered with 500 &lt;em&gt;img&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; tags, which would cause the browser to load these images in parallel to the rest of the page, delaying the “ready” status of the page. In Delayed Loading javascript, triggered once the document has loaded, is used to modify the Html DOM. This way the images are loaded later, once the page is ready and functional for the user. This approach also gives extra control on the size of the images loaded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant code follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

&amp;#x2F;* This loads the avatars asynchronously, so the response time of the page
 improves as images are loaded by the browser after all content is ready *&amp;#x2F;
$(function() {

  &amp;#x2F;* Dynamically select an image size as per viewport size *&amp;#x2F;
  function getAvatarSize() {
    var size = 100;

    &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; we check the viewport width against the sizes in css media queries
    var viewport = $(window).width();
    if(viewport &amp;lt;=  480) {
        size = 25;
    } else if(viewport &amp;lt;= 768) {
        size = 75;
    } else if(viewport &amp;lt;= 979) {
        size = 125;
    } else {
        size = 175;
    }
    return size;
  }

  var avatarSize = getAvatarSize();

  &amp;#x2F;* Load all avatars now *&amp;#x2F;
  $(&amp;#x27;a[data-gravatar-hash]&amp;#x27;).prepend(function(index){
    var hash = $(this).attr(&amp;#x27;data-gravatar-hash&amp;#x27;)
    return &amp;#x27;&amp;lt;img alt=&amp;quot;Avatar Image&amp;quot;&amp;#x27;
      + src=&amp;quot;http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;www.gravatar.com&amp;#x2F;avatar.php?size=&amp;#x27;
      + avatarSize + &amp;#x27;&amp;amp;amp;gravatar_id=&amp;#x27; + hash + &amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;#x2F;&amp;gt;&amp;#x27;;
  });
});

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this code a proper image size (as per the browser size) is selected when the page is ready, and then the img tags are injected into the corresponding placeholders. The result is a delayed loading of secondary content that speeds up the page for the user, providing a better experience specially in slow networks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the impact of these modifications on the page load, see the following network analysis done by Chrome:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;imgposts&#x2F;responsive-network.png&quot; alt=&quot;Network analysis by Chrome&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the page has 2 main blocks of request. The first one corresponds to the basic content of the page (html, css, javascript) and takes &lt;em&gt;less than 300ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. At this point the page is ready and the user can interact with it. The second block starts then and corresponds to the delayed requests, taking &lt;em&gt;additional 315ms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this simple example we get to the “ready” status &lt;strong&gt;50% faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. As you can see, this can be a huge benefit for more complex pages, providing the best UX possible to their customers. Worth the extra effort :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been a while, but the domain is live again! There was some unfortunate incident which wrecked the domain and left my previous blog unusable. After many months of procrastination, I&#x27;ve restored it back to a working state.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons of the delay is the way the site runs now. For a while I wanted to do something more personal than a simple &quot;out-of-the-shelf&quot; blog. I don&#x27;t post regularly enough as to have a blog. I post by whim, when I see something interesting or when I feel I should share something. I was using the &quot;blog&quot; mostly as a storage place for links and documentation. And it was handy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s also a fact that nowadays you need an online presence. As a developer being on LinkedIn or Twitter doesn&#x27;t cut it. It&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s not enough. You have to show what you do. As an old teacher of mine said: &quot;you may be God, but if you don&#x27;t let people know, no one will care&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I needed something akin of a personal page. A place to show what I do, to store links, to share my thoughts and to allow people to contact me. I&#x27;m sure there are many SaaS out there that I could have used as one. But, hey, I&#x27;m a software developer! And I need to build things using Play Framework (yes, it&#x27;s an addiction). So I &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;personal-page&quot;&gt;created my own&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the one you are seeing now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to thank several inspiration sources of this site:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Nesbitt for his &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nesbot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;now-running-on-play-2-beta&quot;&gt;Play 2.0 Beta blog system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Jones for his post on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;erjjones.github.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day&#x2F;&quot;&gt;building your own blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kevin Burke for his &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kev.inburke.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;awesome layout&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which he let me copy and tweak shamelessly&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theoatmeal.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for his impressive tumbeasts (which I hope you won&#x27;t see often in action!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading those pages it&#x27;s hard not to start your own version of your personal page without using a database. I hope it works as expected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy, give feedback, and see you in the next update!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Soon Java 7 will be released. A bit delayed, yes, but it&#x27;s here. Even so the question lingers: is it enough? I believe the answer nowadays is NO, but of course this is an open discussion in which each developer will have a different (and valid) opinion as per each one&#x27;s background. Let&#x27;s give some arguments for the no, then. Let&#x27;s talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-scala&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#why-scala&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-scala&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Why Scala?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why should you learn a new language. If you want to be the average run-of-the-mill developer, no need to. But by learning new languages you improve your skills due to the exposure to new methodologies and idioms. If you&#x27;ve read &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pragprog.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;tpp&#x2F;the-pragmatic-programmer&quot;&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; you know what I mean.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why Scala? Because:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with Scala you will enter the world of functional programming, without leaving the comfort of Object Oriented development. Functional programming helps scalability and testability. Nowadays, with the rise of multicore processors, using a language that facilitates multithreading by removing the need of locks and threads is a huge win.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scala syntax and libraries reduce the lines of code you need to write. And LOC have &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Source_lines_of_code#Relation_with_security_faults&quot;&gt;a direct relation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with bugs: less lines, less bugs.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scala runs in the JVM, and it compiles to the same bytecode as Java. This means you can mix Java and Scala code in a program, giving you access to the vast number of existing Java libraries.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scala removes some of the issues with Java. For example, no more need of Guava collections, Scala gives you what you need.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great web frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;scala.playframework.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; using Scala for web development, good IDE support (like Eclipse or IntelliJ) and knowing you won&#x27;t leave the JVM, there are no real excuses to not start learning Scala. Besides laziness, that is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-that-s-for-geeks-no-one-uses-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#but-that-s-for-geeks-no-one-uses-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: but-that-s-for-geeks-no-one-uses-it&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
But that&#x27;s for geeks, no one uses it&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite true. Yes, early adopters of Scala were geeks, as any early adopter usually is. But nowadays Scala is widely used, and its adoption is growing. You may not see it in &quot;traditional&quot; companies like Accenture. But you know &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? They use Scala. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guardian.co.uk&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Scala. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.linkedin.com&#x2F;about&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Scala. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foursquare.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;new?from=hp&quot;&gt;FourSquare&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;1658&quot;&gt;check by yourself&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ok-but-how-to-start&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#ok-but-how-to-start&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ok-but-how-to-start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Ok, but how to start?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get your hands on a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artima.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;programming_in_scala_2ed&quot;&gt;Programming in Scala&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Read it. And then start coding using Scala as if you coded in Java, don&#x27;t worry about the new stuff. Just code. Check &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;scala&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; when in doubt. Read other people&#x27;s code. As time goes you will find better ways to use the new constructs the language provides, and after a few weeks you will fall into &quot;Scala mode&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was in a Scala talk organised by TypeSafe, the company behind Scala. They mentioned that (in their experience) people starts getting as productive in Scala as in Java after using the language for 4-6 weeks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;960&quot;&gt;official Scala site&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; can help you a bit more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-scala-give-me&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-scala-give-me&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-scala-give-me&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
What does Scala give me?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t list all of Scala capabilities, there is a book you should have bought already for that ;) But if you are curious, some of the features that make Scala great:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Closure_%28computer_science%29&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: Scala supports closures. In Scala a function is a 1st-level construct and as such it can be assigned, passed as parameter, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;135&quot;&gt;Currying&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mixin&quot;&gt;Traits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a type of Mixin that makes composition much more powerful than simple Interfaces in Java&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;107&quot;&gt;Case classes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which along the built-in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;120&quot;&gt;pattern matching&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides a very flexible tool for your algorithms&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;131&quot;&gt;XML&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as part of the language (XML as literal)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful syntax that allows you to define &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;118&quot;&gt;operators&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with names like +, perfect to create &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Domain-specific_language&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallel Collections, which you can use as normal collections but behind the scenes break themselves automatically into pieces to take advantage of multiple processors for certain operations (like map, filter, etc).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;104&quot;&gt;some more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Scala you can do everything you can do in Java. With less code, less effort, less bugs. And you can do some things Java won&#x27;t be able to do in the near future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-sum-it-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#to-sum-it-up&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: to-sum-it-up&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
To sum it up&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Java 7 is not enough. A good step, but not enough. And the reason is that you can use Scala. Java needs to change too much to catch up, even more with the bureaucracy associated to Java processes, and in the meantime Scala will keep evolving.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Java king is dead, long live the Scala king!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/java-7-whats-new/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Java 7 will be released &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datamation.com&#x2F;applications&#x2F;java-7-release-nears.html&quot;&gt;soon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, so it&#x27;s time to check what&#x27;s new. The official announcement is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;7&#x2F;docs&#x2F;technotes&#x2F;guides&#x2F;language&#x2F;enhancements.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. A list of the new additions to our beloved JVM follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary literals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: from now on basic numeric types (byte, short, int, long) can be specified as binary numbers using the prefix 0b or 0B&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underscores in literals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: for readability purposes now we can use underscores to mark numbers. You can put them in any place that helps you to read the number better.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try with resource&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Previously when using some resources like Streams you had to add a finally block just to close it. Now with this new construct Java will close the resource once the try-catch block finishes, either normally or via an exception.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Exception Caching&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: a code saver, from now on the catch clauses accept several exceptions in one clause, avoiding code duplication when several exceptions should be treated the same way. The operator &lt;code&gt;|&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is used for this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better exception analysis on declaration&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: this seems a bit confusing but it&#x27;s simple. If you do a catch Exception, your throws clause in the declaration can still declare very specific exceptions (like IllegalArgumentException). Java will verify that all non-runtime exceptions you generate can only be of the types declared in throws. This allows you to declare better interfaces for error management.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strings in Switch&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: something that was really needed, now you can use Strings as a parameter in the switch statement. Probably is still safer to use enumerations for this, but there are scenarios in which a String-switch is handy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type inference&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: albeit limited when you compare to Scala&#x27;s inference, now we have type inference for Generics. This means less typing as you only need to declare the Generic in the left side of the expression.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New compiler warnings on varargs&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: when using Generics in varargs parameters the compiler will raise new warnings to notify about the possible issues this may cause.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InvokeDynamic for non-Java languages&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: this goes directly into the JVM ecosystem, and it should be a big improvement for languages like Scala. Not something the average Joe programmer will use, but we will feel it on our daily work.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements on NIO library&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: never used it too much, but I guess they will be exciting for some people :)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New UI components&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: a new component, JLayerPanel, has been added. Not much of a Swing guy here, so not much to say.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be missing something, but these are the more relevant ones. Many new things to test this August :) Enjoy the new toys!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/gsoc-2010/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During this time I did not update the blog, I was finishing my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC10+-+Add+Unit+Testing+to+Dspace&quot;&gt;GSOC 2010 project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You can find more technical details &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC+2010+Unit+Tests+-+Technical+documentation&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how&#x27;s been the project? I think this will sum it up:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertvoices.nsdl.org&#x2F;duraspace&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;testing-times-this-summer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertvoices.nsdl.org&#x2F;duraspace&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;testing-times-this-summer&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it feels good to see things like this with your name in he he. Personally it has been a great experience that I recommend to every developer around. It&#x27;s not easy to get in, and it may feel more appealing to stay at home being lazy (or playing Starcraft II) than coding, but it is worth it, I mean it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, what&#x27;s GSOC? GSOC stands for Google Summer of Code. To those who don&#x27;t know how it works, the process is simple: open-source organizations apply to be part of the program. Once selected, students (you need to be a student, although not necessarily in an IT-related branch) propose projects for the accepted organizations. Then Google accepts some projects into GSOC. And you start coding :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you join? Well, for starters you are helping an open source project. No, it&#x27;s not a matter of being a FOSS fanatic or anything. The projects accepted by Google are relevant projects, used by many many people. For example the project I chose, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dspace.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DSpace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, is used by many universities around the world to make their research available in internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&#x27;t convince you, maybe you think about the learning experience. Working in an open source project is very different than your day-to-day job at a company as developer, and you will learn from it. You will also improve your technical skills, as you have a mentor that helps you suggesting ways to proceed and&#x2F;or to improve some pieces of code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not convinced yet? It does look good on your CV.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even so? Well, they pay you a few thousand bucks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get your lazy ass ready for next GSOC! See you in GSOC 2011, hopefully!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Java Vector is Obsolete</title>

        <id>https://perevillega.com/posts/java-vector-is-obsolete/</id>
        
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I was working with a unit test class for my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC10+-+Add+Unit+Testing+to+Dspace&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; project. Launching the test raised a concurrency exception due to me using &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;databene.org&#x2F;contiperf.html&quot;&gt;ContiPerf&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to check the performance of some methods. It&#x27;s a situation that, given the piece of code tested, would not usually happen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seldom doesn&#x27;t equal never, so I proceeded to hunt the source of the error to fix it. The issue was a List that was being accessed via an iterator. The concrete implementation was an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download-llnw.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;6&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;util&#x2F;ArrayList.html&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and I though I had cracked open the issue. I still remember from my &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;in.sun.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;certification&#x2F;java&#x2F;scjp.xml&quot;&gt;SCJP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download-llnw.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;6&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;util&#x2F;Vector.html&quot;&gt;Vector&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the class to use when you want a List that supports concurrency in Java.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I replace it, compile the code, everything seems perfect and... wait a second. Netbeans is marking the line with an exclamation mark, let me check... &lt;em&gt;Vector is deprecated??&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; What&#x27;s going on?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, after a bit of Goggling it seems that Vector is deprecated. The main reason is that Vector does a synchronization per operation. That means you probably need a lock in the vector itself to avoid other threads to change it, as usually you are more interested in a lock for a series of operations, not in a lock for a specific operation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vector had not such good performance in its role, so it has been replaced. By who? Welcome the new kid in the block, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;6&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;util&#x2F;Collections.html#synchronizedList%28java.util.List&quot;&gt;Collection.synchronizedList&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This is a method that takes a List as argument and will return a List with full synchronization whose data is baked by the list you provided.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still need to use a lock if you use an iterator over the list, but for other operations the returned list will be thread safe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: use the list returned by the method, not the one you
provided!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example taken from the official JavaDoc:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
List syncList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());

&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;any operation using syncList will be thread safe
synchronized(syncList) {

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Iterator must be in synchronized block
  Iterator i = suncList.iterator();
  while (i.hasNext()) {
    foo(i.next());
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all. If you were using Vector (as I did until now):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;netbeans.org&quot;&gt;Netbeans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 6.9 so it will warn you the next time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor your code. You will benefit from safer and more efficient code.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s spur some controversy! Outside Spain very few know about the reality of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Catalonia&quot;&gt;Catalonia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For those of you who don&#x27;t know about it, a brief summary of its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_Catalonia&quot;&gt;history&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created in the medieval age, like most kingdoms of Europe, as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crown_of_Aragon&quot;&gt;Crown of Aragon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed as a maritime power, expanding in the Mediterranean and owning islands like Sicily. Its army, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Almogavars&quot;&gt;Almogavars&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, have an interesting story.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unified into Spain in 1469 due to marriage between the Queen of Castilla and the King of Aragon, but keeping its own institutions and laws&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 11th, 1714 (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Day_of_Catalonia&quot;&gt;La Diada&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;): defeat of Catalonia in the succession war. Felipe V creates the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nueva_Planta_decrees&quot;&gt;Nueva Planta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; decrees, removing the Catalan institutions and starting a period of suppression of all that is Catalan&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the later half of 19th century, Catalonia becomes the center of industrialization of Spain&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 14th, 1931: Spain proclaims the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second_Spanish_Republic&quot;&gt;Second Republic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. One year later Catalonia recovers most of its institutions and gets a certain degree of autonomy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1936-1939: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spanish_Civil_War&quot;&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Francisco_Franco&quot;&gt;Franco&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wins and Catalonia loses all its institutions and rights again, and it&#x27;s subject of a strong (and violent) suppression. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homage_to_Catalonia&quot;&gt;Homage to Catalonia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is published by George Orwell.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 20th, 1975: Franco dies&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1978: The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spanish_Constitution_of_1978&quot;&gt;Spanish Constitution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is approved by referendum&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1979: the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statute_of_Autonomy_of_Catalonia&quot;&gt;Second Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is approved&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 16th, 2005: domain &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;.cat&quot;&gt;.cat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is approved by ICANN (unrelated but hey, I&#x27;m a geek!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 30th, 2005: the Third version of the Statute is approved by the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Catalan_Parliament&quot;&gt;Catalan Parliament&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 30th, 2006: Spanish &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Congreso_de_los_Diputados&quot;&gt;Congress of Deputies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; approves the text after removing many parts of the text and changing many more. It is almost a new text.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2006: the Third version of the Statute is approved by referendum (with low turnout, truth be told, due to fragmentation and low reputation of the local government at that time, with some parties rallying people against the text due to the changes made by the central government)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before continuing, I have to do a disclaimer. I&#x27;m Catalan, I feel Catalan and Catalan is my mother tongue, but I&#x27;m not a supporter of independence. I truly believe other formulas, like a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federation&quot;&gt;Federation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, make more sense in the current socio-economic environment and inside Europe. Well, a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magocracy&quot;&gt;Magocracy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; would be much cooler but the fear to a new Voldemort forbids it, and I&#x27;m not ready (yet!) to be the president of a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Technocracy&quot;&gt;Technocracy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;  ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, back on track, now seriously. 2006. 3rd version of the Statute is approved in Catalonia and sent to Spanish Congress of Deputies, where it is approved. It wasn&#x27;t easy, too many politics involved, too much conflict and discrepancies, unwanted changes in the text and many more obstacles but it&#x27;s been done. Everything seems fine, but as you can imagine something went wrong or I would not be writing this. What went wrong is this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 2nd, 2005: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;People%27s_Party_%28Spain%29&quot;&gt;People&#x27;s Party&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; does a recourse on the text of the Third Statue to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Judiciary_of_Spain#The_Constitutional_Court&quot;&gt;Constitutional Court&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Spain. The party also does a recusatio of one member of the Tribunal, accusing him of being partial due to a study he did 8 years ago on the Catalan institutions. It&#x27;s the first time in history a recusatio in this court is accepted and applied, which means that the recused member won&#x27;t be able to decide in this subject.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 26th, 2006: the recourse is accepted&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 20th, 2006: the text, approved by Catalan Parliament, Spanish Congress and popular referendum, is published at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bolet%C3%ADn_Oficial_del_Estado&quot;&gt;BOE&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 30th, 2006: People&#x27;s Party presents a recourse on more than half the text of the Statue to the Constitutional Court. And a second recusatio against the same judge against who they already had presented the previous one. It&#x27;s better to be on the safe side, you know?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2006: many Spanish regions, most of them (but not all) governed by People&#x27;s Party, present a recourse to the text. The fact that some regions unrelated to People&#x27;s Party do that shows how much Spaniards care about us ;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2006-2007: many recusatio are done by the People&#x27;s Party and Catalan government against members of the Constitutional Court with opposite ideology. A purely political move to ensure the &quot;proper&quot; decision on the text. Only the recusatio done by People&#x27;s Party are accepted.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 17th, 2008: one of the members of the Constitutional Court dies. The members which can decide are now 5 right wing members, 5 left wing members and the president, whose vote can decide only in case of a draw. At this time, many of the members of the court should have been replaced (according to the law) as their terms had expired time ago. The death should be covered by a new member.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 26th, 2009: still no decision by the court. Catalan press published a common &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.324.cat&#x2F;noticia&#x2F;422426&#x2F;altres&#x2F;La-premsa-catalana-publica-un-editorial-conjunt-a-favor-de-lEstatut&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (the same in all media) rallying in favour of the text and its approval&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 9th, 2010: 5 years after the text was created, 4 years after it was approved, the final version of the court&#x27;s decision is released. It requests many changes to the text, with the argumentation that they are against the Spanish Constitution. The tribunal is conformed by the same members it was in 2008. No replacement has come for the dead member, and no member has been replaced even when their terms expired long time ago according to legislation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many details lost in here, that you could only understand if you lived in Spain. People&#x27;s Party is a right wing political party, which has made of its hate and attacks versus autonomous regions like Catalonia and Basque Country its flag. They didn&#x27;t complain at all against the Statute of Andalusia, another region of Spain governed by the other big party of Spain, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PSOE&quot;&gt;PSOE&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. That text has similar wording (identical in some cases) to the Catalan one. In fact, People&#x27;s Party voted for it, approving it in the Congress.This and the already mentioned &quot;legal issues&quot; with the composition of the Constitutional Court are just some of many pieces that complete the jigsaw.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant piece here is that the original text, created in 2005, was already modified (a lot) in 2006 by the Spanish Congress. And now they request even more changes. Thanks to political interests, the text is barely an improvement over the previous one. And they took 5 years to do all this. I wonder in which other developed country this would be accepted. 5 years to decide over the text, playing politics and breaking the national law about the composition of the Constitutional Court.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&#x27;t it nice?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past July 10th there was a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;beceene&#x2F;sets&#x2F;72157624344519977&#x2F;&quot;&gt;demonstration&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Barcelona to protest against he verdict of the court. According to the police 1,100,000 people gathered together in Barcelona to show their opposition to the decision of the court. Not bad at all. The biggest since 1978, and that one was for claiming the Second Statute after many years of dictatorship under Franco&#x27;s regime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;elpais.com&#x2F;elpais&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;12&#x2F;actualidad&#x2F;1278922619_850215.html&quot;&gt;media&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynce.es&#x2F;es&#x2F;manifadetalle.php?cod=44&quot;&gt;companies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; said quite a different number (56.000). Funny, as the next day (July 11th) Spain won the world cup, and the same company said 75.000 people had celebrated the achievement in Barcelona. Why it is funny? In this &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitpic.com&#x2F;24oj7b&quot;&gt;image&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; you can see the areas covered by people each of the days (10th and 11th). Do your math. Oh, they justify themselves saying they measured at 20:30 (1 hour after the concentration had ended, perfect time!). It gives you an idea of the love of the media for Catalonia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to here, the facts. Yes, I&#x27;ve not been completely partial in the opinions, but the facts are real. You can check via the links provided or using Google and its translator if required. Go ahead and read about it, I&#x27;m waiting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean? What will happen?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t believe a big change will happen. It&#x27;s been nice to see the people of Catalonia are still proud of their identity. Sadly we can&#x27;t trust our politicians, as they themselves started eroding the text by doing many changes to it in its trip to the Congress and back. Politics (both Catalan and Spanish) have played a big role against its success and the demonstration of last Saturday showed that. People complained against the politicians that were trying to reap some benefit from the event. It was nice to see :) Besides that, a pacific demonstration, no incidents involved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no, I can&#x27;t say what will happen next. What I can say is that all these events are increasing unrest in Catalonia. The media broadcasted recently in TV a documentary named &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tv3.cat&#x2F;adeuespanya&quot;&gt;Adeu Espanya&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&quot; (Bye, Spain) where it showed how Catalonia could be if it was independent. The nationalist feelings, which were always there, are growing stronger by the day. Heck, even I, that usually ignored such stuff, I&#x27;m getting a feeling: &quot;screw Madrid and Spain. No more federalism, let&#x27;s just break with them&quot;. That should mean something to observers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t argue if this is right or wrong, if the events are as they should be or not. I don&#x27;t even care who is right here. The only thing I know is that the way the text (and in extension, Catalan people) have been mistreated, it could not happen in any other country. Not in a country that calls itself &quot;civilized&quot;. Politic games are usually nasty. In this case, they have shown their darkest moves. They have left a sensation of failure in the people that elected them. If they don&#x27;t care about its people, why should the people care about them?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen now? Many people would say &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=enbcjB3aHkE&quot;&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&#x27;m not sure I want it. But, what other alternatives do we have?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Gamers do cry. I think it&#x27;s important to spread this information.

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Due to my current tasks at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC10+-+Add+Unit+Testing+to+Dspace&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code 2010&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I&#x27;ve been setting up a small CI system for my personal use. Yes, it is an overkill, but I wanted to test it and, truth be told, the statistics provided by tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sonarsource.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Sonar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hudson-ci.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Hudson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are priceless, they show you many potential errors you may have in the code, coverage you are missing, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my friend Google for a guide on how to set them up together and it came up with this one. Easy five steps to set them up (check the link for more detail):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Download, install and start the Sonar Server.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Install and Configure Sonar plugin on Hudson.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Configure your Hudson Job&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Build your project&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Browse to Sonar Dashboard (default user is admin&#x2F;admin)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have your CI environment ready to go.  Easy. Simple. Powerful. And useful!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to use the following Sonar plugins:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;Installing+Sonar+in+Eclipse&quot;&gt;Eclipse Plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;Taglist+Plugin&quot;&gt;Tag List Plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;Total+Quality+Plugin&quot;&gt;Total Quality Plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;SCM+Activity+Plugin&quot;&gt;SCM Activity Plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;Sonar+PDF+Plugin&quot;&gt;Sonar PDF Plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;Motion+Chart+plugin&quot;&gt;Motion Chart Plugin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.codehaus.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;SONAR&#x2F;Build+Breaker+Plugin&quot;&gt;Build Breaker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With them you will get some extra data in your reports, you will be able to access them from your IDE (more useful for developers) and the builds will generate a handy pdf report for your project manager. Many benefits for a few customizations. You don&#x27;t even need to change the default settings for any standard project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;barcelona&#x2F;pool&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Barcelona&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This simple and straightforward fact always raises expressions of incredulity amongst the people I meet here in Dublin when I tell them I live here:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&quot;Don&#x27;t you miss the sun?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&quot;How could you leave?&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things become more complicated when they start speaking about football and I have to confess I&#x27;m a follower of Manchester United and I don&#x27;t like FC Barcelona... Yes, it is complicated...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, when I left Barcelona almost 3 years ago now (time flies!) I really disliked the city. I found myself in a country (Spain) where the moral is too ... let&#x27;s call it grey-ish, with a career (IT) underpaid and undervalued, in a region (Catalonia) hated by the other regions of the country. I truly believed the environment was unbearable. I despised it, reason why I chose United as my club, I read only in English, and so on. I just wanted to see Europe, the golden land beyond the northern hills of the country. I wanted to leave.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I landed in Dublin that I started to become aware of the fact that my city, Barcelona, is great. It all started with the people here. If I had to say which nation loves Barcelona the most it wouldn&#x27;t be Catalonia, but Ireland. I can&#x27;t say how many people have explained to me how much did they enjoy their trips there, and their future plans to go back. It seems like the whole island has visited it at one time or another!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this came as a surprise. Hearing so many good things about your city makes you wonder: maybe I was mistaken. And time always enforces the good memories, so as months went on in Dublin, the memories of Barcelona became more partial, leaning towards the good ones, smoothing the bad ones. From time to time I did the mistake of reading a Spanish newspaper and then the old thoughts (fuck off Spain!) came back, at least for a while.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I met Ewa, that polish girl that would become my fiancee, and I still remember her face when I answered to her standard &quot;Where are you from?&quot; with &quot;Barcelona, and you?&quot;. I remember when I brought her to Barcelona for the first time, it was like giving the best present in the world to a child. And in that visit I was in places I had never been, and I saw a city I had never seen. A refreshing view of a place I had ignored for so long while living in it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t lie to myself. Barcelona is far from perfect, specially when you compare it with cities like Munich or New York. But I can agree that it is good enough, and that it has its charm. That it may lack some things, important ones, but it has others to compensate. That I&#x27;ve learned to understand it and appreciate it. And that, probably, if I had never left it I would still not see her cuteness. The one it has, even knowing the ugly that comes with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can only say: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4U6x3yNfeIM&quot;&gt;I&#x27;m from Barcelona. And I&#x27;m proud of it!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During this time I did not update the blog, I was finishing my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC10+-+Add+Unit+Testing+to+Dspace&quot;&gt;GSOC 2010 project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how&#x27;s been the project? I think this will sum it up:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertvoices.nsdl.org&#x2F;duraspace&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;testing-times-this-summer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertvoices.nsdl.org&#x2F;duraspace&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;testing-times-this-summer&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it feels good to see things like this with your name in hehe. Personally it has been a great experience that I recommend to every developer around. It&#x27;s not easy to get in, and it may feel more appealing to stay at home being lazy (or playing Starcraft II) than coding, but it is worth it, I mean it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, what&#x27;s GSOC? GSOC stands for Google Summer of Code. To those who don&#x27;t know how it works, the process is simple: open-source organizations apply to be part of the program. Once selected, students (you need to be a student, although not necessarily in an IT-related branch) propose projects for the accepted organizations. Then Google accepts some projects into GSOC. And you start coding :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you join? Well, for starters you are helping an open source project. No, it&#x27;s not a matter of being a FOSS fanatic or anything. The projects accepted by Google are relevant projects, used by many many people. For example the project I chose, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dspace.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DSpace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, is used by many universities around the world to make their research available in internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&#x27;t convince you, maybe you think about the learning experience. Working in an open source project is very different than your day-to-day job at a company as developer, and you will learn from it. You will also improve your technical skills, as you have a mentor that helps you suggesting ways to proceed and&#x2F;or to improve some pieces of code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not convinced yet? It does look good on your CV.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even so? Well, they pay you a few thousand bucks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get your lazy ass ready for next GSOC! See you in GSOC 2011, hopefully!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ñÑáéíóúÁÉÍÓÚüÜ@¡¿—àèìòùÀÈÌÒÙ$£¥€¢ƒäÄïÏöÖçÇãêß]
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and issue solved! You may need to tweak the reg exp according to your language if you use some extra &quot;non-ASCII&quot; characters, but it&#x27;s easy to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This page contains a brief summary of &lt;strong&gt;EJB 3.0 Services&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and related concepts. It only gives basic information, for more details about life cycle and other functionalities check the EJB 3.0 reference or some book like &lt;strong&gt;EJB3 in Action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I will describe some key concepts related to EJB 3.0&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ejb-context&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#ejb-context&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ejb-context&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
EJB Context&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EJBContext interface (definition available &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javaee&#x2F;5&#x2F;api&#x2F;javax&#x2F;ejb&#x2F;EJBContext.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) provides methods to interact with services like transaction, security, timer or even to do JNDI lookups. Both Session and Message beans implement this interface through inheritance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access this interface through the SessionContext object to be able to call its methods. Depending on which bean are you using (Session or MDB) the container will add some extra methods to the object that may be useful for your bean. Examples of use of context in Session and Message-Driven beans:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
public class PlaceBean implements PlaceLocal {

  @Resource
  private SessionContext context;

}


@MessageDriven
public class MDBTestBean implements MessageListener {

  @Resource
  private MessageDrivenContext context;

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dependency-injection&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#dependency-injection&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: dependency-injection&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Dependency Injection&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEE 5 introduces dependency injection to remove all the hassle related to JNDI calls. You still can do JNDI calls using SessionContext objects but the easiest and recommended way is to use DI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several annotations for this purpose. @EJB is used to inject beans while @Resource can be used as a more versatile mechanism of DI. @Resource allows you to provide a JNDI name of a resource defined in the container and it processes all the calls needed to load that resource, and it can be related to an instance variable or a setter method that follows java bean format.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of dependency injection:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
public class OtherBeanBean implements OtherBeanLocal {

 @Resource(name = &amp;quot;jms&amp;#x2F;ShippingErrorQueue&amp;quot;)
 private Destination errorQueue;

}

@Stateless
public class PlaceBean implements PlaceLocal {

 @EJB
 private OtherBeanLocal otherBeanBean;

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interceptors&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#interceptors&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: interceptors&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Interceptors&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interceptors are a form of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in EJB 3. They are objects that are automatically triggered when some EJB method is invoked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is achieved using the @Interceptors annotation, which can be applied to a method or an entire class (in that case it will affect all methods of the class, you can use the annotation @ExcludeClassInterceptors on a method to ignore the interceptor for that method). The annotation receives as parameters a list of class objects that are used as interceptors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each interceptor class must contain one (and only one) method annotated as @AroundInvoke, that signals the method to be used as interceptor. This method always has the same format, returning an Object and receiving as its only parameter an InvocationContext object. This class provides methods to check the name of the method called, parameters and other details and allows us to modify the parameters passed to the business method if needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interceptor to end always with a call to the &quot;proceed&quot; method of InvocationContext to signal the container it can proceed with the next step (next interceptor or the original method itself). Not calling proceed will halt the chain and the business method will never be accessed. One example of an interceptor and the method intercepted:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class InterceptorExample {

  @AroundInvoke
  public Object logMethod(InvocationContext invocationContext)
    throws Exception{
      log.warn(&amp;quot;Method: &amp;quot;+invocationContext.getMethod().getName());
      return invocationContext.proceed();
  }

}



@Stateless
public class PlaceBean implements PlaceLocal {

  @Interceptors(InterceptorExample.class)
  public void method(){

  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;timer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#timer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: timer&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Timer&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EJB 3 includes a basic timer service to schedule jobs. You can queue objects into the timer inside a bean and assign a method of that bean to process the timer events. Timer can be used to schedule single-events or recurring ones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bean can have only one @Timeout method and it must follow the same structure (void return and receiving a Timer as parameter). You can only receive timer events in the same bean they were created (not same instance!) so you can&#x27;t use Timer to send message across beans by itself, you will need to use JMS in the @Timeout method.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of a simple timer service with a method setting the timer and the @Timeout consumer:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
public class PlaceBean implements PlaceLocal {

  @Resource
  TimerService timerService;

  public void createTimer(){
    String attachment = &amp;quot;attachment&amp;quot;;
    timerService.createTimer(10*1000, 10*1000, attachment);
  }

  @Timeout
  public void scheduledMethod(Timer timer){
    String attachment = (String) timer.getInfo();
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transactions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#transactions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: transactions&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Transactions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JEE container does most of the heavy lifting on transactions, as implementing a working transaction manager is no easy task and is prone to errors. You should review concepts like ACID (atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and two-phase commit before proceeding, to properly understand what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes. In JEE the JTA API is responsible of transaction management.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kind of transactions, container managed transaction (CMT) and bean managed transaction (BMT). CMT is simpler and the container does most of the work while the BMT provides more control over the process in exchange of more coding effort.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use CMT we annotate with @TransactionManagement the class of the bean, indicating with the parameter the transaction will be managed by the container. Then we can flag the class or any transactional methods with @TransactionAttribute. This annotation tells the container how to behave when running the bean&#x2F;method annotated: create a new transaction, reuse any existing transaction, never use a transaction... We must be aware our method may be called form another method that has started its own transaction, so its important to specify the behaviour of our bean. It has 6 choices: Required, Requires New, Supports, Mandatory, Not Supported and Never.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To rollback a transaction you must use the EJBContext, calling its &quot;setRollbackOnly&quot; method. You can check if any underlying CMT transaction has been marked for rollback using &quot;getRollbackOnly&quot;, that way you can exit long operations before they finish as the transaction will fail anyway. An example of a CMT bean:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.CONTAINER)
public class CMTBean implements CMTLocal {

  @Resource
  private SessionContext context;

  @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
  public void transactionMethod(String p1, String p2) {
    try{
        &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;code
    }catch(Exception e){
        context.setRollbackOnly();
    }
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMT is the other type of transaction, one which gives us a granular control over the transaction itself. Instead of it being related to a method we can specify the start of the transaction and its end. It works around the UserTransaction interface of the JTA API, using this interface to start, commit and rollback the transaction. The only annotation used is @TransactionManagement, to tell the container this bean is BMT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface also contains some additional methods to manage the transactions. The method &quot;setRollbackOnly&quot; is used to mark the transaction as &quot;roll back&quot; if our BMT interacts with CMT beans, The method &quot;getStatus&quot; gives us detailed information of the transactional status, while &quot;setTransactionTimeout&quot; allows us to change the timeout of the transaction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of BMT:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)
public class BMTBean implements CMTLocal {

  @Resource
  private UserTransaction userTransaction;

  public void transactionMethod(String p1, String p2) {
    try{
        userTransaction.begin();
        &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;code
        userTransaction.commit();
    }catch(Exception e){
        userTransaction.rollback();
    }
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Security&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEE provides a flexible security model, based on the standard concepts of users, groups and roles, that manages both authentication and authorization. This is achieved using the JASS API, that abstract the underlying authentication systems (like LDAP). If you use a web front-end you will probably define some security aspects in web.xml. This section will only review the part related to EJB.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common use case is called &quot;declarative security&quot;, consisting on some annotations that tell the container who can access which method. One example should be enough to understand it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@DeclareRoles({&amp;quot;RoleA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RoleB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RoleC&amp;quot;})
@Stateless
public class DeclarativeSecurityBean implements DeclarativeSecurityLocal {

  @RolesAllowed({&amp;quot;RoleA&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;RoleC&amp;quot;})
  public void businessMethod1() {
  }

  @PermitAll
  public void businessMethod2() {
  }

  @DenyAll
  public void businessMethod3() {
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, programmatic security uses the EJBContext to check the role of the user. This system should not be used unless completely necessary due to requirements, as it makes the security layer much harder to manage, One good point about this kind of security is that it can be used along interceptors, but even with this advantage if we have several roles managing the system is no easy task.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example will show why it&#x27;s not recommended (think about an application with several beans and roles):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
public class ProgrammaticSecBean implements ProgrammaticSecurityLocal {

  @Resource
  private SessionContext context;

  public void businessMethod() {
    if(!context.isCallerInRole(&amp;quot;RoleA&amp;quot;)
       &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !context.isCallerInRole(&amp;quot;RoleB&amp;quot;)){
       return;
    }
    &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;code for other roles
  }

}

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This page contains a brief summary of &lt;strong&gt;Java Persistence API (JPA)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. It only gives basic information, for more details about life cycle and other functionalities check the EJB 3.0 reference or some book like &lt;strong&gt;EJB3 in Action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence is probably one of the biggest concerns of most enterprise applications. Data is key and we have to be sure it&#x27;s consistent and our application can manage its changes properly. To that end lots of alternatives have been developed, with O&#x2F;R mapping systems taking the led in the latest years due to the benefits of using an intermediate API that&#x27;s closer to the OO model used in the business layer instead of direct interaction with the RDBMS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EJB entities are the answer of EJB 3,0 to the persistence issue and it&#x27;s implementation using JPA follows the same basic patterns as other components like session beans. That means they are POJOs with specific annotations (@Entity for JPA entities) that are capable of inheritance and whose non-abstract classes requires a public or protected no-argument constructor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPA is the most complex part of EJB 3.0. Not only controls the most critical component of our application but it provides a large number of options for a developer to be able to adapt it to his needs. I will try to break this complexity in some sections, like they do in the book EJB in Action, focussing on a few aspects of JPA. Remember this is just a quick summary that won&#x27;t cover lots of aspects of JPA.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-domain-concepts-entities-and-primary-keys&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#basic-domain-concepts-entities-and-primary-keys&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: basic-domain-concepts-entities-and-primary-keys&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Basic domain concepts: entities and primary keys&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above JPA is an O&#x2F;R mapping system. That means it maps Java POJOs (objects) to data stored in the database as tables and rows (relational data). To achieve this JPA does a heavy use of annotations. In this section I will show basic POJOs with some common annotations and explain how they are used. That will enables us to map our tables to the application, although by itself it won&#x27;t let our application work. Let&#x27;s start with a basic entity:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class BasicEntity implements Serializable {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  private Long id;

  @Transient
  private String disposableCode;

  &amp;#x2F;**
   * Get the value of disposableCode
   *
   * @return the value of disposableCode
   *&amp;#x2F;
  public String getDisposableCode() {
    return disposableCode;
  }

  &amp;#x2F;**
   * Set the value of disposableCode
   *
   * @param disposableCode new value of disposableCode
   *&amp;#x2F;
  public void setDisposableCode(String name) {
    this.disposableCode = name;
  }

  public Long getId() {
    return id;
  }


  public void setId(Long id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    int hash = 0;
    hash += (id != null ? id.hashCode() : 0);
    return hash;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object object) {
    &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; TODO: Warning - this method won&amp;#x27;t work if id fields are not set
    if (!(object instanceof BasicEntity)) {
        return false;
    }

    BasicEntity other = (BasicEntity) object;
    if ((this.id == null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; other.id != null)
        || (this.id != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !this.id.equals(other.id))) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return &amp;quot;jpa.BasicEntity[id=&amp;quot; + id + &amp;quot;]&amp;quot;;
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we can see some interesting characteristics of an entity. First one, the entity is marked with the @Entity annotation, that identifies this POJO as an EJB 3,0 entity. Another important step is to override the methods hashcode, equals and toString. This is not mandatory but it&#x27;s considered a best practice to implement hashcode and equals so they use our primary key to identify our entity, and changing toString allows us to log and debug the application easily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistence provider will store the values of any property or field that has public or protected setters and getters, which can&#x27;t be declared final, so no especial annotation is required to enable their persistence. In this example you can see we use a @Transient annotation in one field. This is equivalent to the transient keyword related to Serialization and tells the persistence manager to not persist that specific field.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another detail about the annotations: in this example they are on the fields of the classes. You could write them on the getter methods of those fields, but whatever system you choose you have to stick to it for all you entities. The only difference is that using field-annotation you could make your fields public and not use any getter or setter method and they would be persisted, while using the annotation in the getter method obliges you to implement all the getters&#x2F;setters and make the field private. Given that the first way is a very dangerous and bad practice, so you will have a private field with getter and setters in your entities, choosing one over the other is usually a matter of taste.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve left the @Id annotation for last. This annotation, as you can guess, tells the entity where is stored our unique id. The field that can be marked as Id has some restrictions: it must be a primitive, its wrapper or a Serializable type. Types like double or float are forbidden due to their lack of precision (due to the way computers work, you should know what I mean) and that could cause two different entities to be considered the same.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the @Id annotation is marking only one field and we can&#x27;t have more than one @Id in our class, so what happens if we have a primary key that uses several fields? There are two approaches to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach uses the @IdClass annotation as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@IdClass(BasicEntityPK.class)
public class BasicEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  private Long id;

  @Id
  private String name;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other non Id fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;no need to implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters
}

public class BasicEntityPK implements Serializable {

   Long id;
   String name;

   public BasicEntityPK(){}

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have our main entity class with several @Id fields assigned and a related class that contains the same fields. In this case we implement the equals and hashcode methods in the PK class, not in our entity. With this approach the container will use the entity to persist data and will map internally the fields to the PK class, which will be used when it needs to compare two entities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other alternative is the use of the @EmbeddedId annotation, like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class BasicEntity implements Serializable {

  @EmbeddedId
  private BasicEntityPK basicEntityPk;
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;no need to implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}

@Embeddable
public class BasicEntityPK{

  Long id;
  String name;

  public BasicEntityPK(){}
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeleton is quite similar to the @IdClass one but in this case instead of having the primary key fields on both classes, we just put them in our PK class, and we embed that class into our entity as its primary key. Choosing between any of those methods is a matter of personal taste: one is harder to maintain due to replication, the other makes access to PK fields more awkward. Keep in mind that although you can use those structures sometimes is preferable the use of a surrogate key (we will review it later) as Id, as it will free you code from extra classes and it has better performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have talk about the @Embeddable annotation it might be a good time to explain its meaning. In our data model we may have some data that&#x27;s always related to a certain object but that has sense by itself, like the address of a user. This address contains several fields (city, street) so it may be an entity but it&#x27;s always related to a user. So in the object model it makes sense to implement it as its own object but in the relational model it will be in the same table as the user. To solve this JPA has the option to embed objects into entities, allowing us to declare this kind of relationship. An example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class UserEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;
  protected String name;
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields

  @Embedded
  protected Address address;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}


@Embeddable
public class Address implements Serializable {

  protected String street;
  protected String city;
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-domain-concepts-entities-relationships&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#basic-domain-concepts-entities-relationships&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: basic-domain-concepts-entities-relationships&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Basic domain concepts: entities relationships&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data components in our model will have some kind of relationships between them: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many. These relationships must be defined in our entities so the persistence provider can maintain the proper relations and the data consistency. In this section I will describe the annotations that manage that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First one is the @OneToOne annotation, that defines a one-to-one relationship.This relationship can be unidirectional or bidirectional. Let&#x27;s start with a bidirectional one:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class UserEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;

  @OneToOne
  protected VisaInfoEntity visaInfoEntity;
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}

@Entity
public class VisaInfoEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;

  @OneToOne(mapedBy = &amp;quot;visaInfoEntity&amp;quot;, optional = &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;)
  protected UserEntity userEntity;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we see the relation defined by the annotations in the parameters. Each class contain a parameter of the class that represents the entity related to it marked with @OneToOne. Notice that VisaInfoEntity adds some parameters to it&#x27;s annotation, telling the persistence provider that the &quot;owner&quot; of the relation is the UserEntity class and which field is leading that mapping. The optional parameter set to false tells us there will always be a VisaInfoEntity for each user and a user for each VisaInfoEntity. If we want to convert this to a unidirectional link we just need to remove the reference to UserEntity and its annotation from VisaInfoEntity. With that the container will know our UserEntity may have zero or one VisaInfoEntity related to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second type of relation is defined by the annotations @OneToMany and @ManyToOne. Those annotations usually go in pair to define both sides of the relation one-to-many. Usually in these relations one entity has a field of type Set or List of the other entity. One example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class UserEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;

  @OneToMany (mappedBy =&amp;quot;userEntity&amp;quot;);
  protected Set visaInfoEntity;
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}


@Entity
public class VisaInfoEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;

  @ManyToOne
  protected UserEntity userEntity;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the owning part of the relation is VisaInfoEntity. In these type of relations the many-to-one part is always the leader, something to be aware of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last type of relations is defined by the annotation @ManyToMany. The relation is quite similar to the one-to-many explained above, but we can choose which entity is leading the relationship. An example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class UserEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;

  @ManyToMany (mappedBy =&amp;quot;userEntity&amp;quot;);
  protected Set visaInfoEntity;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}


@Entity
public class VisaInfoEntity implements Serializable {

  @Id
  protected Long id;

  @ManyToMany
  protected Set userEntity;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;other fields
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;implement equals and hashcode
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;getters and setters

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-entities-to-db&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#mapping-entities-to-db&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: mapping-entities-to-db&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Mapping entities to DB&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how to build entities and define relations between them. Now we need to map those entities to the tables of the database, as we will see next. Before looking at the example, be aware that using annotations for that purpose hard-codes the structure, so any changes to it will require a new version of the application. This is usually not a big deal but if you need to be able to change the mappings without compiling, use the XML descriptor version of the fields.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next there&#x27;s an example of a mapped entity. The meaning of the annotations is quite obvious, I will comment them after the code:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Table(name = &amp;quot;USERS&amp;quot;)
@SecondaryTable(name = &amp;quot;USER_PICTURES&amp;quot;,
   pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = &amp;quot;USER_ID&amp;quot;))
public class UserEntity implements Serializable {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @Id
  @Column(name = &amp;quot;USER_ID&amp;quot;, nullable = false,
     insertable=false, updatable=false)
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  protected Long id;


  @Column(name = &amp;quot;USER_NAME&amp;quot;, nullable = false)
  protected String name;

  @Column(name = &amp;quot;USER_LOGIN&amp;quot;, nullable = false, length = 5)
  protected String login; @Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)

  @Column(name = &amp;quot;USER_TYPE&amp;quot;, nullable = false)
  protected UserType userType;

  @Column(name = &amp;quot;PICTURE&amp;quot;, table = &amp;quot;USER_PICTURES&amp;quot;)
  @Lob
  @Basic(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
  protected byte[] picture;

  @Column(name = &amp;quot;CREATION_DATE&amp;quot;, nullable = false)
  @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
  protected Date creationDate;

  @Embedded
  protected Address address;

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;setters, getters, hashcode, equals, etc

}

@Embeddable
public class Address implements Serializable {

  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;fields, setters, getters, hashcode, equals, etc
}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first annotation which we must pay attention to is @Table. This annotation specifies which table contains the columns we will use for the entity. If not specified (both the name or the tag) the system will use a table with the same name as the class.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @Column annotation declares the mapping to a column of the table. As you can see, accepts some extra parameters to indicate if the field can be null or it can be modified using update or insert. The persistence manager assumes the columns exist in the class table, but you can specify another table if needed as you can see at the picture field. As with the @Table annotation, if you don&#x27;t define the name of the column or you8 don&#x27;t add the annotation it will be assumed the column has the same name as the field.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some extra annotations for specific types of data. The @Enumerated annotation allows us to store enumerations. We can use two modes: Ordinal or String. The first will store the integer associated to the enumeration value while the second will store the complete string.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @Lob annotation tell the manager this field will be stored in a CLOB (for char[] or String fields) or BLOB (any other type) column in the database. Usually you add the @Basic annotation to a @Lob object to enable lazy loading, as @Lob objects are usually very memory intensive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @Temporal allows us to store date-related information. By default it uses a granularity of timestamp, but we can choose between DATE, TIME or TIMESTAMP.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the primary key of the application you may use (if it&#x27;s a surrogate key) the @GeneratedValue annotation. This annotation will tell the persistence manager the field&#x27;s value is generated by the database. That means it will only exist once the entity has been committed, so we careful when accessing items not committed yet as they will have a null here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @GeneratedValue annotation has 4 available strategies to assign the value. The simplest one is IDENTITY and assigns an incremental value to the key. The second one is SEQUENCE, that requires a sequence to be defined both in the database and in EJB (using @SequenceGenerator). The third one is TABLE, which uses a a table as generator of the values (with @TableGenerator). The last strategy is AUTO, where the persistence manager decides which one is the best strategy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have skipped an annotation in the class header, @SecondaryTable. This one is used when we need to map an entity to several tables, in this case because we store the BLOB object in another table. As you can see, we tell the annotation which table it has to use and the name of join field. You can use several secondary tables in the same entity. Although this annotation doesn&#x27;t seem so useful, it allows you to distribute content on several tables, which can improve the performance of the RDBMS as it happens in this example where the BLOB would slow queries done to the user table. That said be aware that this annotation is not the same as @Embedded, which we saw before and refers to content in the same table.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you look at the code, you might wonder if maybe we need to specify join keys for tables relationship as we did in the @SecondaryTable annotation. The answer is yes, there are some annotations (three) to that end. I will briefly comment them:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@JoinColumn&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: this annotation allows you to specify primary&#x2F;foreign relations in the database model, when the referencing entity has a primary key and the referenced entity it&#x27;s own primary key and a foreign key mapped to the primary key of the referencing entity. It can be used in one-to-one and one-to-many&#x2F;many-to-one relations.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: this annotation allows you to specify primary&#x2F;foreign relations in the database model when both referencing and referenced entities share the primary key of the referencing table and the referenced table uses it&#x27;s primary key as foreign key. It can be used in one-to-one relations.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@JoinTable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: this annotation allows you to specify primary&#x2F;foreign relations in the database model when you have a many-to-many relation so you need to use an intermediate table to store the mappings. Is used in conjunction with the @JoinColumn annotation to specify the relation between the main tables and the intermediate one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last subject to talk about is how to map inheritance. As we said, JPA are POJO and they can use OO characteristics as inheritance, but how can we write that into the database? I won&#x27;t enter in too much detail, but to this aim we have the @Inheritance annotation. It has 3 related strategies:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single table&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: all data of the different subclases will be stored in the same table and we use one column (specified in the @DiscriminatorColumn annotation) to differentiate between subclasses. Each subclass will be marked with @DiscriminatorValue to tell the persistence manager which value maps to that type of entity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joined Tables&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: we use one-to-one relations to model the inheritance. @DiscriminatorColumn and @DiscriminatorValue are used the same way but we also need to define the @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn between the tables. Is the recommended method.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table per class&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: we use one table per class, including one for the parent entity. No relations must be defined, and the inherited columns are duplicated across tables.Due to possible issues with polymorphism and entity retrieving, is not recommended to use this method&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;entity-manager&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#entity-manager&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: entity-manager&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Entity Manager&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ve seen how to map the entities to the database, but you&#x27;ll probably noticed I said nothing about how the entities are persisted. This section will talk about the Entity Manager, the interface responsible of all CRUD operations that allows you to retrieve and store entities from&#x2F;into the database. An important consequence of this is that JPA being managed by this interface and not the container they don&#x27;t have access to services like injection, timers, etc. It&#x27;s not a big loose due to the way entities are (commonly) used but it&#x27;s something to be aware of. I won&#x27;t talk about the lifecycle in detail, just keep in mind the Entity Manager is only aware of entities in it&#x27;s context (that can be as short as a method call or as long as a session), and an entity is not managed until you persist it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic demonstration of the use of the Entity Manager follows. I won&#x27;t comment the code as it&#x27;s quite obvious:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Stateless
public class ItemManagerBeanBean implements ItemManagerBeanLocal {

  @PersistenceContext(unitName=&amp;quot;contextName&amp;quot;)
  private EntityManager em;

  public Item addItem(String[] params...){
    Item it = new Item();
    &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;do something
    em.persist(it);
    return it;
  }

  public Item updateItem(Item it){
    em.merge(it);
    return it;
  }

  public Item undoItemChanges(Item it){
    &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;we merge to attach to the entity manager before refreshing
    em.refresh(em.merge(it));
    return it;
  }

  public void deleteItem(Item it){
    &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;we merge to attach to the entity manager before removing
    em.remove(em.merge(it));
  }

  public Item getItem(long key){
    return em.find(Item.class, key);
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a scenario that we must discuss in more detail. We may have an entity that contains another entity (maybe in a one-to-one relation) and both are new entities not stored (yet) in the database. Although it seems a logic behaviour that when we persist the enclosing entity both are saved into the database, this is not the default behaviour. This is justified as cascading can be resource intensive when propagating to several instances, and probably most of them have not been modified which means we are wasting resources.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This functionality is defined by the &quot;cascade&quot; property that you can set when declaring relationships between entities (@OneToOne, etc). By default this property is empty so no persistence operation applied to one entity is propagated to related entities. You can change this by setting cascade to one of these values: MERGE, PERSIST, REFRESH, REMOVE or ALL. The first four tell the Entity Manager to propagate only the selected operation while the last one propagates all the persistence operations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;query-api&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#query-api&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: query-api&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Query API&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query API is a mechanism that allows you to find entities using SQL or JPQL, hiding the datasource behind the Entity Manager. It&#x27;s a complement to the find method that allows you to recover several related entities a once. It allows for two kind of queries: named and dynamic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named queries are intended to be stored and reused, allowing for some optimizations. They are defined at class level and can receive parameters, and one entity may have several named queries. Using named queries you can isolate the SQL&#x2F;JPQL from the places where is used, making it more maintainable. You may even define them in xml descriptors, decoupling them from the code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a named query would be:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@NameQuery(name=&amp;quot;findAll&amp;quot;,
   query=&amp;quot;Select c from category c where c.name like :name&amp;quot;);
public class category implements Serializable{
  &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;fields and methods

  public Category getCategoryByName(String name){
   &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;assume em is an instance of the Persistence Manager (Entity Manager)
   &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;find named query by name
   Query query = em.createNamedQuery(&amp;quot;findAll&amp;quot;);
   query.setParamenter(&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;,name);
   return query.getResultList(); &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;returns list of entities
  }

}

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic queries are generated &quot;on the fly&quot;, usually queries received from some other component. When possible is recommended to work with named queries, due to the performance enhancements they allow. En example of a dynamic query:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;assume em is an instance of the Persistence Manager (Entity Manager)
Query query = em.createQuery(&amp;quot;Select c from categories c&amp;quot;);
return query.getResultList(); &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;returns list of entities

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;jpql-and-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#jpql-and-sql&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: jpql-and-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
JPQL and SQL&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPA accepts both JPQL and SQL for queries. Although they look quite similar, SQL works with the relational environment while JPQL works with entities, thus behaving in quite a different way behind the curtain. The recommendation for JPA is to use JPQL always, unless some odd exception requires us to use SQL.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wont enter in details about JPQL as a brief tutorial won&#x27;t cut it. I recommend you to check a good book on the subject.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This page contains a brief summary of &lt;strong&gt;EJB 3.0 Message-Driven Beans (MDB)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. It only gives basic information, for more details about life cycle and other functionalities check the EJB 3.0 reference or some book like &lt;strong&gt;EJB3 in Action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message-Driven Beans are an abstraction over Java Messaging Service (JMS). They are used to send and receive messages in your application without having to know all the details about JMS. That said a good understanding of JMS is important for the correct use of MDB. The advantages of MDB over standard JMS coding are the services provided by the container (like pooling) and the reduction on code size due to automation of tasks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By message (in the context of a JEE application) we mean an asynchronous and loosely coupled communication between system components. Using Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) messages sent are stored until a consumer is available to read them. We consider two types of communication:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point-to-point&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the message is stored in a queue and received by one of the N possible consumers of the message&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publish-Subscribe&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: message is received by N subscribers that belong to a specific group of receivers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDB are POJOs like other EJB and require a public constructor without arguments. You can&#x27;t throw any RuntimeException or RemoteException as that would cause the MDB to be terminated. They also have the following requirements:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implement MessageListener interface&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use @MessageDriven annotation to configure the queue they are listening and some JMS properties (using @ActivationConfigProperty). Values include:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acknowledgeMode: (on Queues) to notify the consumption of the message&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;subscriptionDurability: (on Topics) guaranties delivery of message to offline subscribers&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;messageSelector: filters messages consumed using a property of the message included in the message header&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it has two lifecycle callbacks (@PreDestroy and @PostConstruct) equivalent to the Session Bean ones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can send messages but you need to follow the JMS API for that, using a Connection Factory, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by default the &quot;onMessage&quot; method creates a transaction that rolls-back if there&#x27;s any error while processing the message, leaving the message in the queue for another consumer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This guide will show some basic stuff you might need to maintain an Ubuntu server. You might not need all of them, but thy are handy enough and I&#x27;ve had to use them at least once.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;secure-a-fresh-ubuntu-installation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#secure-a-fresh-ubuntu-installation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: secure-a-fresh-ubuntu-installation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Secure a fresh Ubuntu installation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original source: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mensk.com&#x2F;webmaster-toolbox&#x2F;perfect-ubuntu-hardy-nginx-mysql5-php5-wordpress&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Mensk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you install your fresh server, you have a completely unsafe Ubuntu installation. To make it a bit safer, follow these steps (change names and ports accordingly): Login as root (via ssh or using the console, it depends on your physical access to the machine) and change root password:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;passwd
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add new username - yourself:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    adduser jsmith
    visudo
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Append this line to end of file (to navigate within &#x27;vi&#x27; editor to create next line - use these: L, $, a, &lt;ENTER&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    jsmith ALL=(ALL) ALL
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save and exit do: &lt;ESC&gt;, :wq, &lt;ENTER&gt;. Now let&#x27;s set up SSH configuration:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    nano &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;ssh&amp;#x2F;sshd_config
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find Port 22 and change number to something different (12345) to make hacking more difficult.Then change the following settings:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    PermitRootLogin no
    X11Forwarding no
    UsePAM no
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Append these lines to the very end:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    UseDNS no
    AllowUsers jsmith
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, we must secure the server with iptables&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    iptables-save &amp;gt; &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;iptables.up.rules
    nano &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;iptables.test.rules
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy contents of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;articles.slicehost.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;2007&#x2F;9&#x2F;4&#x2F;iptables.txt&quot;&gt;this file&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (content below) and paste it into &#x27;iptables.test.rules&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    *filter


    #  Allows all loopback (lo0) traffic and drop all traffic to 127&amp;#x2F;8 that doesn&amp;#x27;t use lo0
    -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -i ! lo -d 127.0.0.0&amp;#x2F;8 -j REJECT


    #  Accepts all established inbound connections
    -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT


    #  Allows all outbound traffic
    #  You can modify this to only allow certain traffic
    -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT


    # Allows HTTP and HTTPS connections from anywhere (the normal ports for websites)
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

    #  Allows SSH connections
    #
    # THE -dport NUMBER IS THE SAME ONE YOU SET UP IN THE SSHD_CONFIG FILE
    #
    -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 30000 -j ACCEPT

    # Allow ping
    -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT


    # log iptables denied calls
    -A INPUT -m limit --limit 5&amp;#x2F;min -j LOG --log-prefix &amp;quot;iptables denied: &amp;quot; --log-level 7

    # Reject all other inbound - default deny unless explicitly allowed policy
    -A INPUT -j REJECT
    -A FORWARD -j REJECT

    COMMIT
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change port number to your SSH port number on this line:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 30000 -j ACCEPT
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X). To apply new iptables rules:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    iptables-restore &amp;lt; &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;iptables.test.rules
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then save iptables rules permanently:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    iptables-save &amp;gt; &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;iptables.up.rules
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure iptables rules will apply when server is rebooted as well:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    nano &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;network&amp;#x2F;interfaces
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add new line after these 2:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    auto lo

    iface lo inet loopbackpre-up iptables-restore &amp;lt; &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;iptables.up.rules
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and exit. Reload SSH to use new ports and configurations:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;ssh reload
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep &#x27;root&#x27; session running and open second session. SSH login to your slice to new port, with your new username and password:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ssh -p 12345 jsmith@123.45.6.78
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you logged on successfully via your new username: &#x27;jsmith&#x27; - you may close &#x27;root&#x27; session now. If not - you still have &#x27;root&#x27; session opened to fix problems. As your user, edit .bashrc file to make terminal window a bit more helpful:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    nano ~&amp;#x2F;.bashrc
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Append these lines to the end of it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    export PS1=&amp;quot;\[\e[32;1m\]\u\[\e[0m\]\[\e[32m\]@\h\[\e[36m\]\w \[\e[33m\]\$ \[\e[0m\]&amp;quot;
    alias ll=&amp;quot;ls -la&amp;quot;
    alias a2r=&amp;quot;sudo &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;apache2 stop &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sleep 2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;apache2 start&amp;quot;
    alias n2r=&amp;quot;sudo &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;nginx stop &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sleep 2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;nginx start&amp;quot;
    alias ver=&amp;quot;cat &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;lsb-release&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and exit. Reload .bashrc to make changes active:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    source ~&amp;#x2F;.bashrc
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update sources:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo aptitude update
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set system locale:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    sudo &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;sbin&amp;#x2F;update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade system now:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo aptitude -y safe-upgrade
    sudo aptitude -y full-upgrade
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-the-server-via-ubuntugeek&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#clean-the-server-via-ubuntugeek&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: clean-the-server-via-ubuntugeek&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Clean the server (via &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ubuntugeek.com&#x2F;ubucleaner-simple-bash-script-to-keep-your-ubuntu-system-clean.html&quot;&gt;UbuntuGeek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a special fixation on cleaning my servers. I don&#x27;t want any extra file (package, log, whatever) to be there if it is not needed. That&#x27;s why when I discovered UbuntuCleaner I got quite happy. This tools does this for you:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleans apt cache&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removes config files left from uninstalled .deb packages(it happens if you don’t use the --purge switch with apt-get)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removes every kernel except the one you are using&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empties the trashes of every user(including root)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses apt and the kernel removing thing searches for ubuntu-only packages, so it can’t work on non-debian system and the result is undetermined for other debian-based system, but you can still use the other features of the script(you’ll just have to comment the parts you don’t want).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script assumes that you are using the text-based Aptitude application, rather than apt-get and dpkg. If you are not using Aptitude, you should also replace the reference to aptitude clean with apt-get clean and the reference to aptitude purge to dpkg –purge.This can be done done by editing the following script. First you need to download the script from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;opendesktop.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;show.php&#x2F;Ubucleaner?content=71529&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or using the following command&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    wget http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;www.opendesktop.org&amp;#x2F;CONTENT&amp;#x2F;content-files&amp;#x2F;71529-ubucleaner.sh
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should have 71529-ubucleaner.sh file you need to give execute permissions using the following command&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo chmod +x 71529-ubucleaner.sh
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the script using the following command&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    .&amp;#x2F;71529-ubucleaner.sh
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

Upgrading to a new release (via &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtoforge.com&#x2F;how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-8.04-to-ubuntu-8.10-desktop-and-server&quot;&gt;HowToForge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an Ubuntu server, the main advice is to stick to LTS releases, due to their stability. That said, sometimes you might need to upgrade to a non-LTS release, as it happened to me when Launchpad was released and I wanted to install it (it required 9.04). So here I will describe the steps needed to update your distribution. It assumes you are running a server (no X11 installed) and this is your first upgrade:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First become root:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo su
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    apt-get update
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and install the package update-manager-core:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    apt-get install update-manager-core
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running a LTS release, open the file &#x2F;etc&#x2F;update-manager&#x2F;release-upgrades&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    vi &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;update-manager&amp;#x2F;release-upgrades
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and change Prompt=lts to Prompt=normal. Then run&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    do-release-upgrade
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to start the distribution upgrade.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabling-php-fastcgi-via-howtoforge&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#enabling-php-fastcgi-via-howtoforge&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: enabling-php-fastcgi-via-howtoforge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Enabling PHP-FastCGI (via &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtoforge.com&#x2F;installing-nginx-with-php5-and-mysql-support-on-ubuntu-9.04&quot;&gt;HowToForge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to run fastcgi scripts on your Ubuntu 9.04 machine, you are lucky as this version provides a FastCGI-enabled PHP5 package. To activate it: Install PHP5 on Ubuntu:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    aptitude install php5-cgi php5-mysql php5-curl
    php5-gd php5-idn php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-mcrypt
    php5-memcache php5-mhash php5-ming php5-pspell php5-recode php5-snmp
    php5-sqlite php5-tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then open &#x2F;etc&#x2F;php5&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;php.ini and add the line&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;right at the end of the file. This enables the FastCGI package. But there&#x27;s no standalone FastCGI daemon package for Ubuntu 9.04, therefore we use the spawn-fcgi program from lighttpd. We install lighttpd as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    aptitude install lighttpd
    update-rc.d -f lighttpd remove
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that lighttpd will not start at boot time, as we&#x27;ve installed lighttpd because we need just one program that comes with the package, &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;spawn-fcgi, which we can use to start FastCGI processes. Of course, you don&#x27;t want to type in that command manually whenever you boot the system, so to have the system execute the command automatically at boot time, open &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    vi &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;rc.local
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and add the command at the end of the file (before the exit line):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u www-data -g www-data -f &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;#x2F;php5-cgi -P &amp;#x2F;var&amp;#x2F;run&amp;#x2F;fastcgi-php.pid
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Originally I wanted to install Launchpad on my server to manage my projects. As of 17th of August of 2009, Launchpad is not yet ready for production. The only way to install it is using an script, only available for Ubuntu 9.04, which doesn&#x27;t work too well on a server. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it as I like the way Canonical does things (and applications), but in the meantime I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redmine.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Redmine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as I found Trac lacking on some areas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Redmine&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmine is an open source, web-based project management and bug-tracking tool, written in Ruby on Rails and heavily influenced by Trac. It improves on several areas, like providing multiple project support, integrating with several source control systems (from popular SVN to less popular Bazaar or Darcs) and allowing extension of its functionalities through plugins. This guide describes how to install Redmine in an Ubuntu 9.04 server using Mongrel as web server, Nginx as proxy and MySQL as database. To achieve this we have to follow 3 steps:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install ruby and rails and MySQL&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install Redmine&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install Mongrel and Nginx&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide can be adapted to older versions of Ubuntu and most Linux distributions, just replacing the tools&#x2F;packages by the specific ones available in that distribution. The guide is a quick overview of the main steps, for  more information on configuration options check the documentation of the corresponding tool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-ruby-and-rails-and-mysql&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#install-ruby-and-rails-and-mysql&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: install-ruby-and-rails-and-mysql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Install Ruby and Rails and MySQL&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the components first ensure the system is up to date:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run the following command:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby ri rdoc mysql-server libmysql-ruby ruby1.8-dev irb1.8 libdbd-mysql-perl libdbi-perl
          libmysql-ruby1.8 libmysqlclient15off libnet-daemon-perl libplrpc-perl libreadline-ruby1.8 libruby1.8 rdoc1.8 ri1.8 ruby1.8
          irb libopenssl-ruby libopenssl-ruby1.8 libhtml-template-perl mysql-client-5.0 mysql-common mysql-server-5.0 mysql-server-core-5.0
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have Ruby installed, we use Gems to install Rails:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo gem update
    sudo gem install rails --no-rdoc –no-ri
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flags –no-rdoc and –no-ri are included to reduce the RAM footprint of the component, feel free to remove them if your machine has more than enough RAM. To finish this part, open the MySQL client and create the Redmine database:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    create database redmine character set utf8;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-redmine&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#install-redmine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: install-redmine&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Install Redmine&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the code from the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redmine.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;redmine&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Download&quot;&gt;download&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page. Although the stable release is recommended, if you are going to use Bazaar the svn contains some fixes you want to use, so do an export from the trunk and use that. (Note: if you use the trunk, you&#x27;ll have to install a newer Rails using Gems due to version requirements). Select a folder in your server (from now on, APP) and copy the downloaded code there. Move to the APP folder and run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo cp config&amp;#x2F;database.yml.example config&amp;#x2F;database.yml
    sudo cp config&amp;#x2F;email.yml.example config&amp;#x2F;email.yml
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the new yml files and change the configuration as required (MySQL details, mail server, etc).  Now run these commands to create the database and populate it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=&amp;quot;production&amp;quot;
    rake redmine:load_default_data RAILS_ENV=&amp;quot;production&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need ImageMagick  (although is optional):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev
    sudo gem install rmagick
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-mongrel-and-nginx&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#install-mongrel-and-nginx&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: install-mongrel-and-nginx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Install Mongrel and Nginx&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run Redmine we will use a standard setup for Rails applications, consistent on Mongrel as web server and Nginx as proxy that interacts with the network. We will run Mongrel as Mongrel Cluster, to improve the performance as Mongrel is single threaded and we will need multiple instances to server multiple clients. First we need to install Mongrel and Mongrel Cluster:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo gem install mongrel
    sudo gem install mongrel_cluster
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now move to APP folder and run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    mongrel_rails cluster::configure -e production -p 8000 -N 2 -c APP -a 127.0.0.1
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flag -p indicates the initial port to use by Mongrel. Flag -N tells how many instances you want running in the cluster. Flag -a shows the bind address of the cluster. Once created, we need to set it up so it starts automatically with the server:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo mkdir &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;mongrel_cluster
    sudo ln -s APP&amp;#x2F;config&amp;#x2F;mongrel_cluster.yml &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;mongrel_cluster&amp;#x2F;your-app-name.yml
    sudo cp &amp;#x2F;var&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;gems&amp;#x2F;1.8&amp;#x2F;gems&amp;#x2F;mongrel_cluster-1.0.5&amp;#x2F;resources&amp;#x2F;mongrel_cluster &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;
    sudo chmod +x &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;init.d&amp;#x2F;mongrel_cluster
    sudo &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;sbin&amp;#x2F;update-rc.d mongrel_cluster defaults
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can control the cluster with the commands:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    mongrel_cluster_ctl start
    mongrel_cluster_ctl stop
    mongrel_cluster_ctl restart
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now install nginx (if you don&#x27;t have it):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo apt-get install nginx
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to create a virtual host for Nginx, that will receive the requests and forward them to Redmine. Assuming your public domain will be “domain.com”:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo nano &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;local&amp;#x2F;nginx&amp;#x2F;sites-available&amp;#x2F;domain.com
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And copy inside:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    upstream domain1 {

     server 127.0.0.1:5000;
     server 127.0.0.1:5001;
     server 127.0.0.1:5002;

    }

    server {

     listen   80;
     server_name  www.domain.com;
     rewrite ^&amp;#x2F;(.*) http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;domain.com&amp;#x2F;$1 permanent;

    }

    server {

     listen   80;
     server_name domain.com;

     access_log &amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;demo&amp;#x2F;public_html&amp;#x2F;railsapp&amp;#x2F;log&amp;#x2F;access.log;
     error_log &amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;demo&amp;#x2F;public_html&amp;#x2F;railsapp&amp;#x2F;log&amp;#x2F;error.log;

     root   &amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;demo&amp;#x2F;public_html&amp;#x2F;railsapp&amp;#x2F;public&amp;#x2F;;

     index  index.html;

     location &amp;#x2F; {

          proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
          proxy_redirect false;

          if (-f $request_filename&amp;#x2F;index.html) {
            rewrite (.*) $1&amp;#x2F;index.html break;
          }

          if (-f $request_filename.html) {
            rewrite (.*) $1.html break;
          }

          if (!-f $request_filename) {
            proxy_pass http:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;domain1;
            break;
          }

     }

    }
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful to change the port numbers and domain name to the ones you&#x27;ll use on your server. Now enable the site:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sudo ln -s &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;local&amp;#x2F;nginx&amp;#x2F;sites-available&amp;#x2F;domain.com &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;local&amp;#x2F;nginx&amp;#x2F;sites-enabled&amp;#x2F;domain.com
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and once you restart Nginx your Redmine installation is ready to go. Configure Bazaar First we need to edit the file config&#x2F;environment.rb to add new environment variables related to Python, to avoid problems while accessing Bazaar:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ENV[&amp;#x27;PYTHONPATH&amp;#x27;] = &amp;#x27;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;python2.6&amp;#x27;
    ENV[&amp;#x27;PATH&amp;#x27;] = &amp;quot;#{ENV[&amp;#x27;PATH&amp;#x27;]}:&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;bin&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a project you just need to point Redmine to your Bazaar main folder, this will allow you to browse the repository. Be aware it still has some limitations when displaying contents, but it works quite well. To work with Bazaar, let&#x27;s set up a repository on  our server. This will be a dumb repository, it means is nothing more than a  folder that can be accessed via sftp that stores the data of the repository. First of all, in Ubuntu 9.04 (our server) let&#x27;s install the needed tools (sftp) and enable them as accepted shell:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    $apt-get install ssh openssh-server
    $echo &amp;#x27;&amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;sftp-server&amp;#x27; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#x2F;etc&amp;#x2F;shells
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create a user to connect via sftp to the server:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    $sudo useradd --create-home --home-dir &amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;bzr --shell &amp;#x2F;usr&amp;#x2F;lib&amp;#x2F;sftp-server bzr
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s it, we have a folder (&#x2F;home&#x2F;bzr&#x2F;) ready to receive our Bazaar projects. Is a good practice to give write rights to that folder to members of group “bzr”, and to add a password to the &#x27;bzr&#x27; user. On your client machine, install Bazaar (using apt-get or similar). Then download the Uploader plugin which eases the task to commit changes to “dumb servers”:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    $ mkdir &amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;pvillega&amp;#x2F;.bazaar&amp;#x2F;plugins
    $ bzr co lp:bzr-upload ~&amp;#x2F;.bazaar&amp;#x2F;plugins&amp;#x2F;upload
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or if you use Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    $sudo apt-get install bzr-upload
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create the base repository. There are two ways of doing this, you can create a shared repository which stores every child branch revision, or you can create standalone repositories, which are good if you don’t want to share revision information with other branches. Here we create a shared repository:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    bzr init-repository some_directory
    bzr init some_directory&amp;#x2F;trunk
    bzr init some_directory&amp;#x2F;branches
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to interact with the server we created before, first run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    bzr push --create-prefix sftp:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pushes the project to the server and creates the folder &#x27;test&#x27; if needed. After that, all the interaction with the server can be (usually) reduced to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     bzr pull sftp:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test   #update changes from the server to our client
     bzr co sftp:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test      #checkout the project
     bzr push sftp:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test  #push changes to the server
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, is not the nicest way to do that, but remember this is a distributed repository, you won&#x27;t update or push changes too often, usually only when you are done with a piece of work.  There&#x27;s an alternative method, using what is called a “smart server”, which is faster than the previous way (but not always possible to use for several reasons). In this case we will use an ssh connection to communicate with the repository, but this requires that our user belongs to the group “bzr” to be able to write in that folder. The command for the first commit is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    bzr push --create-prefix bzr+ssh:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;server:port&amp;#x2F;home&amp;#x2F;bzr&amp;#x2F;test #requires full path, from root
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way we interact with the server using:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     bzr pull bzr+ssh:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test   #update changes from the server to our client
     bzr co bzr+ssh:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test      #checkout the project
     bzr push bzr+ssh:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;bzr@server:port&amp;#x2F;~&amp;#x2F;test  #push changes to the server
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-redmine-themes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#install-redmine-themes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: install-redmine-themes&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Install Redmine Themes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install some new themes for Redmine, available &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redmine.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;redmine&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Theme_List&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Although is mainly a cosmetic change, some themes provide enhancements like colouring tickets according to priority and they are really easy to manage. For example, to install the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theill.com&#x2F;stuff&#x2F;redmine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; theme:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download application.css&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create required directories: mkdir -p redmine&#x2F;public&#x2F;themes&#x2F;basecamp&#x2F;stylesheets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy downloaded file:  cp application.css redmine&#x2F;public&#x2F;themes&#x2F;basecamp&#x2F;stylesheets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it .. now restart your instance running Redmine and select the new basecamp theme from &#x2F;settings&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-redmine-plugins&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#install-redmine-plugins&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: install-redmine-plugins&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Install Redmine Plugins&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmine provides several plugins that enhance the capabilities of the tool. Amongst them you can find some nice ones like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots Filter: avoids bots from accessing certain areas of the application&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charts: adds some project based charts&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception Handler: notifies admins when an exception occurs&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hudson: integrates Redmine and Hudson, allowing you to see Hudson reports&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status updates: allows users to say what are they doing, kind of Twitter per project.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote: allows users to vote on issues so you see which ones are important to them&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find these and many more in this &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redmine.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;redmine&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plugin_List&quot;&gt;page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; . To install a plugin, follow the instructions on the “Installation” section of its page. Then restart Redmine and you are good to go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;connect-mylyn-to-redmine&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor no-hover-padding&quot; href=&quot;#connect-mylyn-to-redmine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: connect-mylyn-to-redmine&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link-icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Connect Mylyn to Redmine&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Mylyn (and you should!) use these &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redmine.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;redmine&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HowTo_Mylyn&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to connect it to your Redmine repository.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Analyzing your site&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your application is running, you may want to know why users are
leaving. True, there are mechanisms to communicate with them and receive
feedback, but not all users will do that. And there are some reasons
they will never tell you or are hard to describe, because it’s just a
“Feeling” for them. To help you there are some tools that can give you
more information on their real reasons:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;analytics&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Google Analytics:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; basic for any web application, it will show
you the traffic trends of your site and the relevant pages&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;crazyegg.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CrazyEgg:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;this is a heat map of your application that will show
you where users clicks. It will even show you parts that have been
clicked but have no links, giving some hints for improvements.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clicktale.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ClickTale:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; it shows you how the users browses your page,
including scrolling and keys pressed, so you can learn how they use
it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;googletalk.blogspot.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;02&#x2F;google-talk-chatback.html&quot;&gt;Google Talk Chatback:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; allows you to receive more feedback and
even interact with your customers solving their issues and maybe
increasing your user base due to personalized support&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surveymonkey.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Survey Monkey:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; another way to obtain useful feedback, using a
survey&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;4q.iperceptions.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;4Q:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; similar to the one above, a questionnaire to show when users
leave your site&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kampyle.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kampyle:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a tool to make easier for your users to provide
feedback about the application&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;sitesearch&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Google Search:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; adding this to your web application will allow
you to know what are your users looking for&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serph.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Serph:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; tracks what are people telling about you in the net,
extracting information from blogs, news…&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.yahoo.com&#x2F;yslow&#x2F;&quot;&gt;YSlow:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; shows you why your site is slow, or how could be faster.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.skynet.be&#x2F;mgueury&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;&quot;&gt;HTML Validator:&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a Firefox plugin that validates your generated
HTML code for W3C compatibility&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

More help&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.websiteoptimization.com&#x2F;secrets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Website Optimization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that has received quite a
lot of praise. It has useful hints about SEO, performance optimization
and conversion rate. Reading it will probably help you to improve your
site in a couple of areas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to externalize your images, will save you bandwidth and your server
will see a reduced load. Also, try to find tools that compress your
Javascript and CSS files so their transfer time is smaller.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that performance is not so important once your pages load
fast enough. Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;glinden.blogspot.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;11&#x2F;marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html&quot;&gt;think again&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. According to this, your pages should
load as fast as possible, 500ms better than 600ms, or your revenue might
suffer. To help you IBM gives &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;developerworks&#x2F;web&#x2F;library&#x2F;wa-speedweb&#x2F;&quot;&gt;20 more tips&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to improve the speed of
your site.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the blog has been migrated. Sadly, due to format issues and my sloppiness, several posts have been lost. Like in gone. Forever. Nothing too relevant that can&#x27;t be found in other places, but over 2 years of posts are gone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it sucks. And stings a bit. It&#x27;s time spent and gone for nothing.  Oh, well, let&#x27;s try to keep the bright side. Let&#x27;s take the chance to start from scratch and improve the content :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
