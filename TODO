/superpowers:brainstorm "ultrathink, I want to modify this app. This project is currently
a personal blog using Zola, published to github pages under the perevillega.com
domain. I want to modernise it, as I want to add new sections related to services I offer
as a freelancer and to allow people to contact me directly.
You can see some layouts I like in pages like:
- https://agynamix.de/
- https://academy.alignthority.com
- https://www.designjoy.co/?via=landing
- https://saasrock.com/mvp-as-a-service
The links above are examples of professional designs that I like, it doesn;t mean we have to copy every functionality, adjust to the aims of the website we are building.
Some thoughts or requirements I have for the page are:
 - individual blog posts and also series (blog posts that are part of a single series and I want them shown as both single blogposts and compiled somewhere as the series with table of content, etc)
 - Pages showcasing projects (past and current)
 - calendly or equivalent to book meetings (I use macOS calendar, is there an easy or free way to do this?)
 - custom offering packs for productised services I offer as a freelancer
 - stripe integration or some integration for paid consultations
 - zoom integration
Ask questions on this and let's work together to modernise the site.
I want to technology stack to be moved to Astro + TailwindCSS + github deployment.
Use themes, try to find out good free themes or suggets preimium themes that would be suitable for this.
Use subagents when possible, particularly when doing research. Use mcp for web search

/superpowers:execute-plan "use parallel agents to implement @docs/plans/2024-12-22-astro-migration-design.md, use context 7, use tdd.
Some bits may be already implemented, verify using subagents before you start. You can read file @docs/plans/2024-12-30-implementation-progress.md for more context"
