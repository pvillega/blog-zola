            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During this time I did not update the blog, I was finishing my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC10+-+Add+Unit+Testing+to+Dspace&quot;&gt;GSOC 2010 project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You can find more technical details &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.duraspace.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;GSOC&#x2F;GSOC+2010+Unit+Tests+-+Technical+documentation&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how&#x27;s been the project? I think this will sum it up:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertvoices.nsdl.org&#x2F;duraspace&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;testing-times-this-summer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertvoices.nsdl.org&#x2F;duraspace&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;testing-times-this-summer&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it feels good to see things like this with your name in he he. Personally it has been a great experience that I recommend to every developer around. It&#x27;s not easy to get in, and it may feel more appealing to stay at home being lazy (or playing Starcraft II) than coding, but it is worth it, I mean it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, what&#x27;s GSOC? GSOC stands for Google Summer of Code. To those who don&#x27;t know how it works, the process is simple: open-source organizations apply to be part of the program. Once selected, students (you need to be a student, although not necessarily in an IT-related branch) propose projects for the accepted organizations. Then Google accepts some projects into GSOC. And you start coding :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you join? Well, for starters you are helping an open source project. No, it&#x27;s not a matter of being a FOSS fanatic or anything. The projects accepted by Google are relevant projects, used by many many people. For example the project I chose, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dspace.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DSpace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, is used by many universities around the world to make their research available in internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&#x27;t convince you, maybe you think about the learning experience. Working in an open source project is very different than your day-to-day job at a company as developer, and you will learn from it. You will also improve your technical skills, as you have a mentor that helps you suggesting ways to proceed and&#x2F;or to improve some pieces of code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not convinced yet? It does look good on your CV.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even so? Well, they pay you a few thousand bucks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get your lazy ass ready for next GSOC! See you in GSOC 2011, hopefully!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
