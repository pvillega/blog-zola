Kinda. But it has been a fun road to travel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say ‘kinda’ is because the last lesson consists on a relatively big project (classifying tweets) which I will skip. It can be quite time consuming and I feel after the previous lessons I understand the concepts behind Storm well enough. I believe that, even if I spend now a few evenings doing this project, I will forget stuff from lack of use of Storm after it. Thus, it feels a better investment of my time to focus on other areas right now and put that effort whenever I need to use Storm for something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the course was very useful. I liked the format, and it gave me a good library of examples I stored in &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;udacity-storm&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and can be used in the future to refresh my memory. A tip: if you do the course, don’t skip the interviews at the end of lesson 4. They have some nice insights.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished the second lesson of &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;ud381&quot;&gt;Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. At this stage I should be able to understand how Sprouts and Bolts interact, and to parse data from Twitter in real time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting lesson. I like a lot the fact that you have videos explaining what to do, then a text document describing steps, followed by a video with the solution. It makes it easy to go through the course, and if you are tight on time you can skip the first video (and go back to it if you get stuck).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the use of Twitter data very interesting, seeing all that data coming to you in real time… wow. The only downside is that the server (run in your localhost) to visualise the results was dying under the pressure. The fans of my MacBook Pro were spinning like crazy, but the server couldn’t handle the sheer amount of data. Oh, well, lesson learned!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest I have the feeling my solutions for exercise 6 and 7 may not be correct, but due to the visualisation problem mentioned above I can’t verify if that’s the case. I’m not too worried, though, as the aim of this lesson is to understand the concepts behind connecting Sprouts and Bolts, which I did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my solutions to this lesson in &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;udacity-storm&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; famously said that &lt;em&gt;Why Software Is Eating the World&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. There is a lot of truth in this but if we think about it a bit more it feels that, nowadays, the way this is happening is via machine learning and analytics. These are the tools that can move personalization to the next level and, with it, changing the way services interact with customers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is just to justify why I’ve started the first lesson of &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;ud381&quot;&gt;Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a free &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; course. Recently I’ve tried to narrow down things I do to a few relevant ones, instead of being too spread out into many unrelated tasks. And, as I wrote at the start of the post, I truly believe real-time analytics is the next big software revolution (well, arguably is already ongoing, not that I’m a visionary of any kind) so, as a developer, any effort on it is worth the time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how was it? The course has 4 lessons and today I’ve finished the first one. This is an introductory lesson in which you set up your environment and you learn some of the pitfalls of real-time analytics along what’s the role of Storm in this field.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code wise you have some very simple problems in which you modify existing topologies, but I feel these basic exercises help you getting familiar with Storm’s architecture. Judging by the advice and some of the steps required, the lessons are aimed to people with minimal knowledge of Java and Maven but that’s not bad (you will do that part faster if you know them).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting to see how the second lesson works out for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my solutions in &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;udacity-storm&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
