            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been a while, but the domain is live again! There was some unfortunate incident which wrecked the domain and left my previous blog unusable. After many months of procrastination, I&#x27;ve restored it back to a working state.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons of the delay is the way the site runs now. For a while I wanted to do something more personal than a simple &quot;out-of-the-shelf&quot; blog. I don&#x27;t post regularly enough as to have a blog. I post by whim, when I see something interesting or when I feel I should share something. I was using the &quot;blog&quot; mostly as a storage place for links and documentation. And it was handy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s also a fact that nowadays you need an online presence. As a developer being on LinkedIn or Twitter doesn&#x27;t cut it. It&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s not enough. You have to show what you do. As an old teacher of mine said: &quot;you may be God, but if you don&#x27;t let people know, no one will care&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I needed something akin of a personal page. A place to show what I do, to store links, to share my thoughts and to allow people to contact me. I&#x27;m sure there are many SaaS out there that I could have used as one. But, hey, I&#x27;m a software developer! And I need to build things using Play Framework (yes, it&#x27;s an addiction). So I &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;personal-page&quot;&gt;created my own&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the one you are seeing now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to thank several inspiration sources of this site:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Nesbitt for his &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nesbot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;now-running-on-play-2-beta&quot;&gt;Play 2.0 Beta blog system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Jones for his post on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;erjjones.github.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day&#x2F;&quot;&gt;building your own blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kevin Burke for his &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kev.inburke.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;awesome layout&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which he let me copy and tweak shamelessly&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theoatmeal.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for his impressive tumbeasts (which I hope you won&#x27;t see often in action!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading those pages it&#x27;s hard not to start your own version of your personal page without using a database. I hope it works as expected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy, give feedback, and see you in the next update!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the blog has been migrated. Sadly, due to format issues and my sloppiness, several posts have been lost. Like in gone. Forever. Nothing too relevant that can&#x27;t be found in other places, but over 2 years of posts are gone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it sucks. And stings a bit. It&#x27;s time spent and gone for nothing.  Oh, well, let&#x27;s try to keep the bright side. Let&#x27;s take the chance to start from scratch and improve the content :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
