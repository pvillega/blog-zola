            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And more work in the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Data_science&quot;&gt;data science&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; world. I’ve joined yet another &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; class: &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;ml-008&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Yes, I might be overdoing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest this is a class I started time ago but I had to drop due to lack of time. So it was great news to realise that it was running again, just when I want to focus on this area. The videos are very helpful and after doing the first practical exercise I’m very happy as the hands-on experience allows you to play around and imagine areas in which you could already apply this. Very motivating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the lessons about Octave proved beneficial as it facilitated solving the exercises in the other class I’m taking, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;mmds-002&quot;&gt;Mining Massive Datasets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As I wrote in my last post, I wasn’t sure if to continue that class as I didn’t want to spend hours doing matrix calculations by hand (laziness, or maybe just trying to be more efficient). Octave solved that by letting me automate the process. A win - win situation!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to publish the code in Octave, but unfortunately this goes against the Code of Honour, so… maybe another time :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

First week done, how was it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that, unfortunately, I found it discouraging for a developer. Don’t take me wrong, the course is fine and plenty of developers will love it. But my maths are &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; rusty, it’s been a long time since I had to do things like multiplying matrixes. So the first week has been harder than expected: I can calculate your &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MapReduce&quot;&gt;MapReduce&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solutions with little effort, but iterating over PageRank…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that, personally, I like more a ‘hands-on’ approach and the fact this course is so theoretical puts me off a bit. One gets used to a quick-feedback loop during development and moving to the pure-theory realm is hard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I understand all the course will follow the same pattern (videos and quiz) with some coding exercises as &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; deliverables with no impact in your grade. I doubt many people attend a MOOC for the grade (at least if you are taking the free ones) so most of the effort in the course will be to understand purely theoretical approaches. I’m not denying their usefulness, but given my limited free time I may have to drop this course if things keep at the same level, as at my current level of data science knowledge I won’t benefit too much from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scala is growing, a lot. The (relatively) recent &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.typesafe.com&#x2F;typesafe-announces-14m-series-b-financing&quot;&gt;investment of $14M&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the company ensures that the language will be taken care of and any remaining issues (like some necessary improvements for the IDE) tackled. Scala 2.10 is &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scala-lang.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;12797&quot;&gt;around the corner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and with it all the performance and APi improvements. And &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playframework.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is healthier than ever. Good times to be a Scala fan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big step to make Scala more popular has been the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;class.coursera.org&#x2F;progfun-2012-001&#x2F;class&#x2F;index&quot;&gt;Functional Programming in Scala course from Coursera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For people like myself who  learned the language via some book and StackOverflow questions, it’s been a very welcomed training to ensure Scala foundations were good enough and to polish the functional approach to coding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the approach is very academic, and in fact some problems are solved in convoluted ways just to force the student to implement specific methods. But all in all the course is great. The videos from Martin are polished and the explanations well delivered. And the automatic evaluation method is a nice touch :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the course itself has served as trigger for some other interesting things:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;Dublin-Scala-users-group&#x2F;events&#x2F;80995152&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Scala meetup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was organized in Dublin, where we were able to chat and learn some more advanced techniques when using Scala&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found myself being able to solve problems from &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aperiodic.net&#x2F;phil&#x2F;scala&#x2F;s-99&#x2F;&quot;&gt;99 Scala problems&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with less effort, which seems to point to an increase in my Scala skils (&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pvillega&#x2F;scala99problems&quot;&gt;some code available at Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, will be completing it as time allows)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could convince 3 other guys from my current job to join the course. It’s very good to share and compare notes on the exercises (no copying, I swear!), makes it much easier to understand new concepts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been long since I felt so comfortable and happy when coding in a given platform or language. Not many people will read this, but if you do: try it! It’s worth the effort. With such an active community and so many companies adopting Play and Scala, it’s silly not to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all this, through the Scala course I discovered how great Coursera is as a learning platform. The downside for people addicted to learning like myself is that it could become time consuming in the near future (I joined around 20 courses for the next year) but the fact that you can resign at any time and that you may decide to not deliver the homework but still keep access the theory is of great value. It will be interesting to see if they can solve the issues around peer-grading, as they lower the value of some courses a bit. But the number of relevant subjects is incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, between Scala and Coursera (and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;play-modules&#x2F;modules.playframework.org&quot;&gt;some other projects&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) I’m keeping myself busy. But lots of fun ahead :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
