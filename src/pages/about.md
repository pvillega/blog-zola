## Hi! I'm Pere Villega

I'm a principal engineer with over 20 years of industry experience in distributed systems, data pipelines, and production AI. I help companies identify constraints that AI can remove, then build the systems that make 10x operations possible. Not faster demos, but capabilities that didn't exist before.

I run [Aracon Software](https://aracon.com), providing AI and software consulting to companies.

I live in Barcelona and have been working remotely or hybrid since 2014.

## About This Blog

This blog focuses on software engineering topics, with an emphasis on how technology serves business needs. I believe that good software engineering is not just about writing code, but about understanding the business problems we're solving and delivering value effectively.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out through any of the social links on this site. I'm always happy to discuss production AI, distributed systems, software engineering, and how to build capabilities that compound.
