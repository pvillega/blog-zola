## Hi! I'm Pere Villega

I'm a principal engineer (currently freelancing) with over 20 years of industry experience.
I write about software engineering, and how to build better solutions for your business.
I live in Switzerland, but I've been working remotely or hybrid since 2014.

## About This Blog

This blog focuses on software engineering topics, with an emphasis on how technology serves business needs. I believe that good software engineering is not just about writing code, but about understanding the business problems we're solving and delivering value effectively.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out through any of the social links on this site. I'm always happy to discuss software engineering, architecture, and how to build better solutions.
