## Collaborative System Design

Work directly with your team to design a new system or redesign an existing one. This hands-on workshop combines my expertise with your team's domain knowledge to create robust, scalable solutions.

## Workshop Process

### Day 1: Discovery & Requirements
- Understand business goals and constraints
- Identify key stakeholders and users
- Define success criteria and non-functional requirements
- Map current state (if redesigning)

### Days 2-3: Design Sessions
- Explore solution alternatives
- Make architecture decisions collaboratively
- Create detailed system diagrams
- Design data models and APIs
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies

### Days 4-5: Documentation & Planning
- Finalize architecture diagrams
- Document key decisions and trade-offs
- Create implementation roadmap
- Break down into development phases
- Knowledge transfer to team

## Deliverables

- **Architecture Documentation**: 20-30 pages covering system design
- **Visual Diagrams**: Component, sequence, and deployment diagrams
- **API Specifications**: Endpoint definitions and data contracts
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased plan with effort estimates
- **Decision Log**: Record of key architectural decisions and rationale
- **Follow-up Support**: 2 weeks of email/Slack support post-workshop

## Perfect For

- **New Systems**: Starting a greenfield project with solid foundation
- **Redesigns**: Modernizing legacy systems or addressing scalability issues
- **Critical Features**: High-impact features requiring careful design
- **Team Alignment**: Getting everyone on the same page about technical direction

## Workshop Formats

**On-site**: I travel to your location (travel expenses separate)
**Remote**: Fully virtual via video conferencing
**Hybrid**: Combination of remote prep and on-site sessions

## Example Scenarios
