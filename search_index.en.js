Companies announce they are leaving “The Cloud” (meaning, usually, AWS), for huge savings. This seems counter to all they have ever told us about the benefits of the cloud. But a lot of people seem to be copying the cool guys. In an industry where new trends get adopted without a second thought that is not a surprise.\nUnderstanding that you are not copying trends thoughtlessly, then the question is: should you do it? And, if so, where should you go? In this post I’ll summarise some of the reasons why the Cloud has lost its appeal for some companies, and what alternatives there are.\n\nThe incumbent\n“The Cloud”, in effect AWS and a sprinkle of GCP and Azure, have dominated the landscape for many years. There is a generation of developers that have never known a world without it: EC2 came into public beta in 2006. 18 years ago.\nI’m not going to rehash the history of the first services offered by AWS, like EC2 and S3. What we need to remember is what was the status-quo at the time. When you needed a server, you couldn’t just get one. You had to buy one of these, get it delivered in a few weeks if lucky, get space in your data center, and go to install it. Compare that with doing a few clicks on a website and waiting 15 minutes. It was revolutionary: cheaper and faster than the current way of working.\nThe cloud had another benefit: it allowed turning CAPEX into OPEX. Not long after, the post-2008 financial crisis period and the ZIRP environment started. That meant it was a better choice for companies to use the cloud. This is important: capital preservation was a key motivation for moving towards the cloud\nBut, as the Cloud became more and more popular, complexity arrived. Over a hundred new services in AWS. Kubernetes release. Serverless. In the meantime, no real competitor appeared for AWS, with GCP and Azure still far behind in market share even today. All this had consequences.\n\nThe broken promises\nThe cloud delivered value, that can’t be argued with. Many companies wouldn’t be possible without it. Why, then, this growing disenchantment with it?\nFirst of all, it would be unfair to not acknowledge that the customers themselves share some of the blame. As I mentioned before the industry loves copying, particularly anything that big tech does. This is how we ended with companies using Hadoop or Spark for Big data, despite their big data fitting in memory in a single machine.\nThe core of the issue is that the original promises of the cloud are currently not true. The AWS cloud was a better and cheaper way to provision servers. That’s not such a clear proposition anymore, at least with the hyper-scale cloud.\nThe first big issue is the value for money proposition. The instance types page in AWS shows that a C5.large instance is using a CPU architecture from 2017, with 4Gb of RAM, at $0.085. For comparison, Hetzner offers a server with a CPU from the same year and 8 GB of RAM at €0.0238 ($0.03 at current rate). For the $0.08 that AWS costs, you can get dedicated servers with 64Gb RAM and a CPU from 2023. This server performs 2x better in single core tasks, and 40% better in multithreaded tasks. I’m not the only one noticing the disparity.\nAs we can see, you get a much worse deal with AWS. Hetzner is one example, but there are other providers (Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr, and so on) with the same advantages. Yes, Amazon has saving plans with use commitment, but it is not the only platform that offers that.\nThe cost issue goes further than that. AWS surprise bills are not uncommon, to the point that there are articles explaining what to do when it happens. And the billing can be so confusing that whole companies exists to help you manage that part of your operations. To be fair, runaway costs are not exclusive to AWS, with some serverless providers being another notorious culprits. But it is a big risk for a smaller company.\nAnd now that I mention serverless, there are also broken promises with serverless. Serverless should be about not caring about scaling your app, either up or down. The price per hour is more expensive, but you only pay for the real use. So it ends up being cheaper (unless you have 24/7 use, in which case you want an EC2 instance). That should mean that the service scales down to 0 when no one is using it. That is not always true.\nThis muddling of the name comes along another issue, specific to serverless in AWS. The proliferation of services mean you may end up with architecture diagram like this one:\n\nProponents of serverless argue this is exposing the real complexity of the app. It may be, but these components add very strong coupling and contribute to vendor locking. Additionally, all these extra services are billable. In several cases the billing rules are arcane. The end result is an increase of the cost of running the application.\nTo summarise: the cloud provided economic advantages, without extra development work. But, recently, the value proposition doesn’t seem to be there anymore. And the complexity around some services has increased, making the benefits of the trade-off less clear.\n\nSwapping Clouds\nIs The Cloud (understood as AWS) bad, then? No, of course not. If you are a company like Netflix, it makes sense to use this flavour of the cloud. Or if you have specific regulatory compliance needs (say, HIPAA). Or for many other scenarios.\nBut I suspect that too many companies use AWS because it is the default. We underestimate the power of inertia. When most of the industry uses Terraform, AWS (or similar platforms), and Kubernetes, what will they choose for their next project?\nAnd we also underestimate how much it is possible in modern hardware. The days of C10K are far behind. WhatsApp was serving 2 million connections from a single server, in 2012. Pieter Levels was running all his startups in a single Linode box, in 2014. StackOverflow run the site in just 9 servers, taking advantage of vertical scaling. More than 8 years ago, computers were already powerful, imagine nowadays.\nIn an era where servers with dedicated CPU are not expensive, and the hardware can do so much more, it is time to rethink our infrastructure. Yes, there is no silver bullet, but do we need to go all-in with AWS? Are there no alternatives for us?\nI need to clarify what I’m not proposing. I’m not telling you to go back to on-prem. Yes, that DHH post with their savings by doing moving to om-prem is popular. It works for them, but it is not sure if it will work for you. There is a set of pre-requirements to do that, which are not universal. From staff that has experience managing the servers in the data center, to CAPEX capability.\nWhat I am suggesting is to look at alternatives to AWS, and understand if there is a reason why you could not use them. Companies running applications in AWS connect routinely to SaaS offerings like Aiven, Papertrail, or Honeycomb. They get extra functionality outside AWS, using AWS mainly for their compute workloads. Is there a reason you must pay more for a worse compute service? Is there some critical service in AWS itself you need and forces that decision? Or can you move away?\nLet me show you what I mean, by going over alternatives you have depending on your preferences.\n\nYou really like AWS/GCP/Azure\nYou like The Cloud, you have nightmares thinking about the times before EC2. Or, maybe, you have never experienced an alternative way of doing things. You would need convincing to leave your walled garden.\nThat is understandable, and I’m not going to say it is a mistake. But I would suggest that you develop a framework to test if it may be worth considering other options. I am going to write an example next. It is an example, it is not exhaustive, and it should be adapted to the reality of your business. But it will give you an idea of what to ask:\n\n\nWhat are your compliance needs? If you need HIPAA, working in AWS may be easier. For SOC2, alternative platforms are good enough.\n\n\nDo you need global presence? If you only serve one region (for example, Europe), multi-region is less valuable. For global presence, current edge solutions like Fly.io or Cloudflare may be enough. Or your business may need multi-region AWS for other reasons.\n\n\nWhat are your usage patterns? Predictable workloads, with little change between peak and off-peak, work well with dedicated servers. Very volatile or event-based traffic is more cost-effective with serverless or cloud elasticity. If you use a lot of spot instances, the economics may not differ that much.\n\n\nHow much are you spending in AWS now, and how much would it cost in another platform? How much engineering effort you need to move? If it takes a huge effort, you may not recover the cost in a long while, making the investment not worthy. But what if the break even point is just 6 months? It turns into a more enticing proposition.\n\n\nWhat are the skills of your team? If you needed to hire people to make this happen, then it is not an option. You can (and should) upskill the team, but that will increase the total cost of the migration.\n\n\nAs I mentioned, those are some examples. You should ask yourself questions about the current infrastructure, team, and costs, and see if a move could work. Even if you are not planning to move, it may be a good exercise, helping you detect waste in your infrastructure.\n\nYou like Kubernetes\nKubernetes is not my cup of tea, but it would be foolish to deny the tool. It is a industry standard for a reason. Now, you can be lucky and use managed Kubernetes in GCP, and there you will have a decent experience, compute premiums aside. But I’ve often heard that managed Kubernetes in AWS is, at best, subpar. AWS is the dominant cloud, which means it is likely your Kubernetes experience is not great.\nIf that is the case, and your operations team have the skills, you should look at Reclaim the Stack. It is a Kubernetes-based deployment platform designed to work like a PaaS (think Heroku). It provides you with most of what you need: Gitops, Ingres, Databases, Observability, and more.\n\nYou don’t like managing servers\nYour ideal platform was Heroku, but that is not a good choice anymore. Managing a server is a big responsibility. Security updates, avoiding downtime, managing the load, and the myriad of tiny annoyances that come with the task. You could use Kubernetes, but then again that brings its own set of problems. You can try the following:\n\n\nCloudflare: the Cloudflare ecosystem is one of the most impressive for serverless I’ve seen up to now. More so considering the price, with a generous free allowance and a subscription that includes plenty of compute. Cloudflare Pages works out of the box with many popular frameworks, making deployment a breeze. And there are the extra services: databases (D1), storage (R2, cheaper than S3 and without transfer fees), Durable objects, and more. No, I’m not paid by Cloudflare, but I like their service.\n\n\nDigital Ocean Apps: you can deploy a Docker container or code from a Github/Gitlab repository directly. You can also connect to the other services offered, like Redis, Postgres, local S3, etc. One of the closest replacements for Heroku that I’ve seen. That said databases can become expensive as traffic grows, and you need a more powerful setup.\n\n\nRender is a service like Digital Ocean Apps, where you can deploy your app into managed nodes, with the option to add databases and other services. As Digital Ocean, it can become pricey at some level of use. But worth considering when you start.\n\n\nRailway is another app service. They provide an environment in which you can deploy many services, and you only pay per real use. The risk with this model is any unexpected costs. Luckily they provide the option of purchasing prepaid credits, which can limit exposure.\n\n\nSpecial mention to Unison, a revolutionary service. Unison provides a supercomputer for your software. The tradeoff is that you need to code in the Unison language. In exchange, you don’t have to worry about deployments, versioning, and many other tasks that we have normalised in the era of the microservice. As it is common, it offers a free tier. I’d recommend you to check it out.\n\nYou are ok with some infrastructure work\nManaging a server is ok, but you would like some automation. Tooling has improved, we are in 2024 after all. There are common operations that you should find preconfigured. You want to limit the time spent in Terraform and Ansible, while having more control.\nYou are in luck, there are services for that too:\n\n\nCleavr.io : this service works on top of your servers, which you have to provision separately on a VPS (see the next section for that). But for $15 per month, you get the full package: securing servers, database backups, monitoring, push to deploy, and more. The downside? It’s geared to deploying node and php apps, so it won’t be as useful if you use other programming languages.\n\n\nCloud66 is an alternative to Cleavr. It allows you to work in any programming language as it supports Docker deployments, but in exchange it is more pricey ($25 per month). Besides that, the offering is similar, it manages the machines you provisioned in your VPS.\n\n\nCoolify is a service like Cleaver and Cloud66, but with an important difference: it is open source. So you can download it and host it yourself. Or you can contribute to the development, by using their cloud offering, which is very affordable. It offers a complete package of functionality, but the documentation for some functionality is lacking.\n\n\nDokku is an opensource project that tries to reproduce the functionality of Heroku. It requires you to set it up in a server, and then you are ready to go, you can target other servers for deployment.\n\n\nFly.io is slightly different. You can deploy applications with a single docker image, and scale them as needed, and you pay per usage. But you are responsible for any backup of data stored in the Fly Machines.\n\n\n\nYou are old school, bring the bare metal\nYou have seen the old times, with data centers and bare metal. You just want to provision servers faster, without having to travel to the location. You can handle the setup. I have good news for you.\nThe gold standard currently is Hetzner. It offers a variety of servers, from dedicated to managed to VPS, all via their web console.\nBut that is not the only alternative. If you only care about VPS, Vultr, Linode, Digital Ocean, and many other providers have similar offerings . Choose your server and start working almost immediately. And, often, you can scale vertically as your workload grows without having to migrate the server.\n\nConclusion\nThe list above is not exhaustive. There are services I have not listed intentionally due to their reputation (many customers are unhappy), and others that I am not aware of. There’s no denial that we are spoiled for choice.\nThe industry defaults to AWS because, paraphrasing the old adage, no one has ever been fired by buying more AWS services. But the offerings in 2024 are not the ones we had 10 years ago, and it may be better for your project or company to look for an alternative platform. You may get better compute resources and save operational costs at the same time. And without taxing your teams with extra engineering work.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/cloud-exit-mirage-aws-alternatives/","title":"The Cloud Exit Mirage: A Practical Guide to AWS Alternatives"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/durable-computing-hype/":{"body":"Durable computing has emerged as a topic in systems design. It may just be my bubble, but it feels as if, suddenly, AI stopped being the next big thing and durable computing is going to solve all our problems.\nI’ve also noticed some misunderstandings about the concept. Thus, I’m taking this chance to pen some explanation on what durable computing is, and why you should care. Or not. Let’s start.\n\nThe process to durable computing\nI believe it is very important to understand the technological steps that brought us a technology. Otherwise, you end up with people not understanding that LLMs have randomness at their core. So I will start by tracing the origins of durable computing.\nThe first appearance of durable computing is something you are likely familiar with: database transactions. Jim Gray’s seminal work on transactions and two-phase commit in the 1970s built the foundation for the first transactional systems with ACID semantics.\nTransactions are a self-contained sequence of steps that either all happen or none happen, guaranteeing that the data stays consistent no matter what. This is also the core idea behind durable computing: preservation of state, and managing failure gracefully so that state doesn’t degrade.\nThe next step came with the workflow engines of the 1990s. Microsoft BizTalk and similar products moved from handling atomic operations to managing long-running processes that could span arbitrary amounts of time. Like with transactions, these workflow engines are still in use. The concepts behind them are the foundation of a lot of current tooling, like some products for microservices orchestration.\nThis was a big step (pun not intended). At this stage, we don’t rollback a few operations; we track state across multiple tasks, which may include interactions with other systems and human approval. The complexity is readily apparent, as we need to be able to respond to events and correct errors in the middle of a workflow without corrupting the state.\nThe issue with workflow engines is that they are complex products. There are tradeoffs to using them. This meant that some developers looked for simpler alternatives, and they found them when message queues (like RabbitMQ) and the Event Sourcing pattern started becoming more popular. Together, they enable a developer to achieve durability by ensuring message delivery even on consumer failure, while reducing the complexity of maintaining the system.\nThis change has some nuance, though. We move from a single monitoring system to multiple independent systems. Each service may use a database to handle internal state via transactions, maybe using STM (Software Transactional Memory) libraries. Communication with other services happens via queues, in asynchronous fashion. With both, we achieve durability and decoupling, and each piece is simple to manage. But it is harder to get a view of the global state, as it involves more components.\nUnfortunately, in some cases, queues are not enough. Some operations must be synchronous. For example, booking a trip. As we enter the era of microservices, we may have distributed transactions that span multiple other services, and the required synchronicity of the operation means we can’t use queues for durability.\nThe solution, and the last step in this evolution towards durable computing, is the Saga pattern. A mechanism to manage distributed transactions in microservice architectures. Sagas break down long-running processes into a series of smaller, local transactions, each with a corresponding compensating transaction that can undo its effects if something goes wrong.\nSagas are a great insight building on top of all the previous experience. The compensation mechanism ensures that we don’t corrupt the state, and we can always retry from the point where a failure occurred. For those using existing durable computer services, this is the pattern that services like Temporal.io force you to follow when you declare a workflow with AddCompensation steps.\nAnd that’s how we reached durable computing.\n\nIs that really it?\nYes, that’s it. Durable computing is a simple concept, albeit not an easy one to implement correctly.\nTraditional computing operates on the principle that a program’s state exists only while it’s running. When the program stops, its state is lost unless explicitly saved.\nDurable computing, in contrast, automatically preserves program state across failures, restarts, and even machine boundaries.\nNeed an example? Think Microsoft Word (running locally) vs. Google Docs. With Word, you need to save (or enable Autosave) to avoid losing your progress due to an unexpected crash. With Google Docs, data is automatically preserved, and you can recover without losing state after a crash .\nAs I mentioned, the concept is simple. The implementation, however, is not. When implementing durable computing patterns, you’ll inevitably face CAP theorem tradeoffs. For instance:\n\nSaga Pattern implementations often sacrifice immediate consistency for availability. When a distributed transaction is in progress, different services might temporarily show different states. This is a direct consequence of choosing AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) over C (Consistency).\nEvent Sourcing systems typically favor eventual consistency, making them AP systems. This means they can continue operating during network partitions, but there’s a window where different parts of the system might see different states. This is particularly relevant in globally distributed systems.\nSome durable computing platforms attempt to provide CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance) guarantees by using consensus protocols like Paxos or Raft. While this ensures strong consistency, it can impact availability during network partitions. Temporal.io uses this approach.\n\nUnderstanding these tradeoffs is crucial when choosing your durable computing implementation. For example, a financial system might require strong consistency and choose to sacrifice some availability, while a content delivery system might prefer high availability with eventual consistency.\nHowever, the core concept remains as explained in the previous section. It’s not a revolution but an evolution, and platforms that market themselves as durable computing solutions are simply making certain choices for you.\n\nWhy should a business care?\nThe technology spiel is very nice, but in the end, we serve a business. Should it care? The answer is yes. This is important for the same reason transactions are important for a business. You want data integrity.\nSome business processes may take a long time and require manual approval of some steps. Others must be synchronous, due to customer expectations or the nature of the process itself. In both cases, data consistency is important. But modern applications consist of multiple services, which make ensuring that consistency harder.\nThus, the concept of durable computing is something important, even critical, to your business. That said, what you care about is the data integrity part. The label, not so much.\nCaring about data integrity also surfaces another truth: not all your systems need to be durable, implementing all the patterns we mentioned. Let’s not forget that adding compensating mechanisms makes the code more complex, to start with.\nNot only that, durable computing patterns themselves add overhead to the system. Event Sourcing adds I/O overhead, event replay can increase latency, and consensus protocols in CP systems (as discussed above) can require multiple round trips.\nState reconstruction takes time. Due to all these factors, among other unmentioned issues, it is not unusual to see performance drops as high as 20%. This has direct cost implications, as more (or larger) servers are needed to provide the same service.\nThere are business processes which are fine with eventual consistency and Event Sourcing alone. For other processes, discarding the full task and starting again may be a valid step. Using durable computing for them can be a waste of resources, both developer time and compute.\nIn all likelihood, only a few business processes will benefit from durable computing. But for those cases, we want to ensure that we are resilient to errors, and we want to implement all the patterns we can to avoid problems later on.\n\nCan I add durable computing to my system?\nThere are many options for you to start using durable computing without having to migrate to a specific platform. Start using Event Sourcing if you are not doing so, and the Saga pattern on relevant operations in your services.\nIf you are using the JVM, the Axon framework provides a SagaEventHandler annotation, among others, for Saga management. Or you can use Akka, which provides persistent actors which are, in essence, durable computing interfaces.\nIf you are using Go, there are libraries like Go-Saga to help you. You will likely find equivalent libraries for your language of choice.\nFor AWS users, you can rely on Step Functions as a mechanism for durable computing. Just beware, as at scale they are expensive even by AWS standards. Azure has the equivalent functionality with Durable Functions.\nUsers of the Cloudflare ecosystem can rely on workflows in their workers, along with Durable Objects, for durable computing.\nAs you can see, you probably don’t need to migrate to a new platform or learn a new language. It is completely possible to achieve this with your current stack and provider.\nThere are many new platforms like Temporal.io that promote themselves as the true way to achieve durable computing. They may be better in some cases, and they will provide bells and whistles that may make the developer experience simpler. Just beware of the costs of adopting a new technology.\nAn important note on the above: I’ve seen the proliferation of several services that promote themselves as the only true way to do durable computing. Due to some cursed history I wish I wasn’t aware of, I suspect a few are not being honest with their marketing or benchmarks.\nThat is my way of saying that, please, test your use cases properly. Those services may charge you a premium over what you could already achieve in-house with existing tools. They may be worth it. But don’t trust their word at all. Run your tests, your failure scenarios, before you commit to using them. Evaluate if you can do the same in your current platform and stack. Worst case, you are then convinced they fulfill your needs. Best case, you avoid a headache later on, when their marketing reveals itself empty.\n\nThat’s all\nThe concept of durable computing is not a complex concept, nor something as innovative as it may seem at first glance.\nIt is important for a business. There is also a lot of marketing muddling things, as we are prone to do in the software world. But data consistency matters.\nThe question is not if you need durable computing. The question is if you need a new platform to achieve it. Avoid all hype, always test and verify first.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/durable-computing-hype/","title":"What's the hype about durable computing?"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/ejb-concepts-and-services/":{"body":"This page contains a brief summary of EJB 3.0 Services and related concepts. It only gives basic information, for more details about life cycle and other functionalities check the EJB 3.0 reference or some book like EJB3 in Action.\n\nNext I will describe some key concepts related to EJB 3.0\n\nEJB Context\nThe EJBContext interface (definition available here) provides methods to interact with services like transaction, security, timer or even to do JNDI lookups. Both Session and Message beans implement this interface through inheritance.\nYou can access this interface through the SessionContext object to be able to call its methods. Depending on which bean are you using (Session or MDB) the container will add some extra methods to the object that may be useful for your bean. Examples of use of context in Session and Message-Driven beans:\n\n\nDependency Injection\nJEE 5 introduces dependency injection to remove all the hassle related to JNDI calls. You still can do JNDI calls using SessionContext objects but the easiest and recommended way is to use DI.\nThere are several annotations for this purpose. @EJB is used to inject beans while @Resource can be used as a more versatile mechanism of DI. @Resource allows you to provide a JNDI name of a resource defined in the container and it processes all the calls needed to load that resource, and it can be related to an instance variable or a setter method that follows java bean format.\nExamples of dependency injection:\n\n\nInterceptors\nInterceptors are a form of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in EJB 3. They are objects that are automatically triggered when some EJB method is invoked.\nThis is achieved using the @Interceptors annotation, which can be applied to a method or an entire class (in that case it will affect all methods of the class, you can use the annotation @ExcludeClassInterceptors on a method to ignore the interceptor for that method). The annotation receives as parameters a list of class objects that are used as interceptors.\nEach interceptor class must contain one (and only one) method annotated as @AroundInvoke, that signals the method to be used as interceptor. This method always has the same format, returning an Object and receiving as its only parameter an InvocationContext object. This class provides methods to check the name of the method called, parameters and other details and allows us to modify the parameters passed to the business method if needed.\nThe interceptor to end always with a call to the “proceed” method of InvocationContext to signal the container it can proceed with the next step (next interceptor or the original method itself). Not calling proceed will halt the chain and the business method will never be accessed. One example of an interceptor and the method intercepted:\n\n\nTimer\nEJB 3 includes a basic timer service to schedule jobs. You can queue objects into the timer inside a bean and assign a method of that bean to process the timer events. Timer can be used to schedule single-events or recurring ones.\nOne bean can have only one @Timeout method and it must follow the same structure (void return and receiving a Timer as parameter). You can only receive timer events in the same bean they were created (not same instance!) so you can’t use Timer to send message across beans by itself, you will need to use JMS in the @Timeout method.\nExample of a simple timer service with a method setting the timer and the @Timeout consumer:\n\n\nTransactions\nThe JEE container does most of the heavy lifting on transactions, as implementing a working transaction manager is no easy task and is prone to errors. You should review concepts like ACID (atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and two-phase commit before proceeding, to properly understand what’s going on behind the scenes. In JEE the JTA API is responsible of transaction management.\nThere are two kind of transactions, container managed transaction (CMT) and bean managed transaction (BMT). CMT is simpler and the container does most of the work while the BMT provides more control over the process in exchange of more coding effort.\nTo use CMT we annotate with @TransactionManagement the class of the bean, indicating with the parameter the transaction will be managed by the container. Then we can flag the class or any transactional methods with @TransactionAttribute. This annotation tells the container how to behave when running the bean/method annotated: create a new transaction, reuse any existing transaction, never use a transaction… We must be aware our method may be called form another method that has started its own transaction, so its important to specify the behaviour of our bean. It has 6 choices: Required, Requires New, Supports, Mandatory, Not Supported and Never.\nTo rollback a transaction you must use the EJBContext, calling its “setRollbackOnly” method. You can check if any underlying CMT transaction has been marked for rollback using “getRollbackOnly”, that way you can exit long operations before they finish as the transaction will fail anyway. An example of a CMT bean:\n\nBMT is the other type of transaction, one which gives us a granular control over the transaction itself. Instead of it being related to a method we can specify the start of the transaction and its end. It works around the UserTransaction interface of the JTA API, using this interface to start, commit and rollback the transaction. The only annotation used is @TransactionManagement, to tell the container this bean is BMT.\nThe interface also contains some additional methods to manage the transactions. The method “setRollbackOnly” is used to mark the transaction as “roll back” if our BMT interacts with CMT beans, The method “getStatus” gives us detailed information of the transactional status, while “setTransactionTimeout” allows us to change the timeout of the transaction.\nAn example of BMT:\n\n\nSecurity\nJEE provides a flexible security model, based on the standard concepts of users, groups and roles, that manages both authentication and authorization. This is achieved using the JASS API, that abstract the underlying authentication systems (like LDAP). If you use a web front-end you will probably define some security aspects in web.xml. This section will only review the part related to EJB.\nThe most common use case is called “declarative security”, consisting on some annotations that tell the container who can access which method. One example should be enough to understand it:\n\nOn the other hand, programmatic security uses the EJBContext to check the role of the user. This system should not be used unless completely necessary due to requirements, as it makes the security layer much harder to manage, One good point about this kind of security is that it can be used along interceptors, but even with this advantage if we have several roles managing the system is no easy task.\nOne example will show why it’s not recommended (think about an application with several beans and roles):\n\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/ejb-concepts-and-services/","title":"EJB Concepts and Services"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/emacs-and-scala-in-mac-os-x-yosemite/":{"body":"After hearing a lot about the benefits of using Emacs to code in Scala, I’ve decided to give it a go and also to document the steps to work with it, in case anyone else feels crazy enough to try this.\n\nWhy?\nI guess first I should explain why would I use Emacs when there are products like IntelliJ IDEA which provide a lot of functionality and are easy (easier?) to use. This is a personal decision, but some reasons I’ve found to try Emacs are:\n\n\nIDEA sometimes shows misleading errors with Scalaz. Add some EitherT or similar to your code and suddenly correct code that is built by Sbt with no complains is flagged red by IDEA. This is because they use their own compiler, and although it seems a minor issue it can become annoying (is this IDEA acting or did I break it?) and fixing it requires adding explicit type annotations to your code, which means more verbosity and less readable code.\n\n\nResource efficiency. This last summer, due to me changing jobs, I had to bring back to life my 7 year old desktop with its non-ssd hard drive and only 4 Gb of ram. Trying to code in it was extremely annoying. I had only IDEA, a browser and a terminal open, but it felt clunky and focussing was hard due to constant system slowdowns. Replacing IDEA by a simple text editor helped a lot, but there was a lack of syntax highlighting and other tooling I was used to. I don’t know if/when I may find myself in a similar situation again, so being comfortable with a leaner IDE has become relevant.\n\n\nRSI. Luckily I’m not suffering from it but I’m a frequent customer of physiotherapy due to heavy mouse use harming my shoulders. I’ve been told repeatedly that Emacs is a great environment to reduce these muscular issues, better than IDEA, so it’s worth the effort.\n\n\nI don’t mind the new payment policy of Jetbrains; I’ve been paying for my license for years and renewing for each new version, so it would make no difference to me. But the change highlights the dangers of being tied to a proprietary tool and unexpected changes to them. If we believe in the software craftsmanship movement and we care about our tools, we need full control on them.\n\n\nLet’s be honest, knowing Emacs sounds cool. I may fail on the task and realise I’m not the nerd I expected to be, but it’s worth the test ;)\n\n\n\nEnvironment\nI’m going to install Emacs in a MacBook Pro with Yosemite.\nThere are several Emacs packages you can choose from, the one I’ve been recommended is Scapemacs so I’ll be trying this one.\nFor Scala goodness I’ll use Ensime and its Emacs plugin.\nI won’t research any other plugins by now, geting used to Emacs is enough.\n\nInstalling Spacemacs\nSpacemacs is a bundle of configuration and plugins for Emacs, as a consequence before starting you will need Emacs installed. As of today Spacemacs recommends to use the emacs-mac-port package, available in Homebrew:\n\nAfter that, it is recommended to backup your current Emacs config:\n\nTo install Spacemacs, just clone the repo along its submodules to ~/.emacs.d:\n\nOnce done, launch Emacs and wait for the set up to be done:\n\n\nScala and Emacs\nSpacemacs provides integration with Ensime via this package. It works as a layer, to install it just edit your ~/.spacemacs file and find dotspacemacs-configuration-layers near the top of the file. Add scala as a new layer:\n\nThen restart Emacs. Next create a global plugins.sbt at ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugin.sbt and add to it:\n\nRun sbt once in some of your projects to download the dependency.\nTo work with a Scala project you will need to create a .ensime file by running\n\nAt the root.  To load Ensime, type SPC : ensime and wait until the environment is configured, which may take a while the first time.\n\nLearning Spacemacs\nAfter Emacs loads all the configuration you are welcomed by… an ugly yellow screen. Ugh. Yes, it will take a while to get used to this, no one said it would be easy ;) There are two resources I’m using to get started:\n\nHow to Learn Emacs\nLearning Spacemacs\n\nI started with the Evil-adapted Vimtutor to get familiar with the key bindings. Press SPC h T to launch it.\n\nFirst day feelings\nThis is hard. I’m ashamed to acknowledge how long did it take me to open a file in Emacs, much less to compile it via Sbt.\nI can see the benefits of learning Emacs and not having to use the mouse much, but it will take effort to get used to this and to get the ‘right’ environment setup working.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/emacs-and-scala-in-mac-os-x-yosemite/","title":"Emacs and Scala in Mac OS X Yosemite"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/enums-to-json-in-scala/":{"body":"Scala gives the developer the possibility of using Enumerations. If they should be used or if Case Classes are better is a debate I’m not going to start here. They exist and they can be used.\n\nThe reason I mention enumerations is that in a personal project (which I hope to publish soon, but I digress) I’ve been using them inside some case classes. In the same project I’m using Play-JSON, a standalone version of the Play Framework JSON libraries, which turn working with JSON into a boilerplate-free pleasure. All was grand until I added my first enumeration as a parameter in a case class. The compiler started to complain and it took me a while to find how to fix it.\nThe solution was provided by, who else, StackOverflow which in just 5 years has become an invaluable resource. I thought this may be useful to other people, so I created some basic sample code showing the solution to the issue and pushed it to a Github repository. As always, feel free to clone and comment.\n\nThe issue\nLet’s assume we have the following code structure:\n\nWe can take advantage of Play-JSON and create a companion object for our case class that will helps us serializing instances of this class from or into JSON.\n\nUnfortunately, when compiling we will get errors due to the enumerations missing valid Reads and Writes. We can test this by removing the enum parameters from the case class and replacing them by simple types as shown below. The code works and converts the case class into JSON, which proves that the issue is the enumeration type that can’t be managed by Play-JSON.\n\n\nSolution\nThe solution is, obviously, to provide Reads and Writes for the enumerations. But we would like to do it in a generic way, to avoid duplication of very similar code. StackOverflow provides an example of a support class that can accomplish this:\n\nThis creates an object that provides generic Reads, Writes and Format methods that can be used with any enumeration. We can use the methods in our enumerations, adding some implicit vals of type Reads and Writes that will redirect the execution flow to the support object, as follows:\n\nBy adding this support object and the enumeration-specific vals, we can now compile the project and serialize our case class into JSON.\nGo to the Github repository and experiment with the code.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/enums-to-json-in-scala/","title":"Enums to JSON in Scala"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/estatut-de-catalunya-a-review/":{"body":"Let’s spur some controversy! Outside Spain very few know about the reality of Catalonia. For those of you who don’t know about it, a brief summary of its history:\n\n\nCreated in the medieval age, like most kingdoms of Europe, as part of the Crown of Aragon.\nDeveloped as a maritime power, expanding in the Mediterranean and owning islands like Sicily. Its army, the Almogavars, have an interesting story.\nUnified into Spain in 1469 due to marriage between the Queen of Castilla and the King of Aragon, but keeping its own institutions and laws\nSeptember 11th, 1714 (La Diada): defeat of Catalonia in the succession war. Felipe V creates the Nueva Planta decrees, removing the Catalan institutions and starting a period of suppression of all that is Catalan\nIn the later half of 19th century, Catalonia becomes the center of industrialization of Spain\nApril 14th, 1931: Spain proclaims the Second Republic. One year later Catalonia recovers most of its institutions and gets a certain degree of autonomy\n1936-1939: Spanish Civil War. Franco wins and Catalonia loses all its institutions and rights again, and it’s subject of a strong (and violent) suppression. Homage to Catalonia is published by George Orwell.\nNovember 20th, 1975: Franco dies\n1978: The Spanish Constitution is approved by referendum\n1979: the Second Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia is approved\nSeptember 16th, 2005: domain .cat is approved by ICANN (unrelated but hey, I’m a geek!)\nSeptember 30th, 2005: the Third version of the Statute is approved by the Catalan Parliament\nMarch 30th, 2006: Spanish Congress of Deputies approves the text after removing many parts of the text and changing many more. It is almost a new text.\n2006: the Third version of the Statute is approved by referendum (with low turnout, truth be told, due to fragmentation and low reputation of the local government at that time, with some parties rallying people against the text due to the changes made by the central government)\n\nNow, before continuing, I have to do a disclaimer. I’m Catalan, I feel Catalan and Catalan is my mother tongue, but I’m not a supporter of independence. I truly believe other formulas, like a Federation, make more sense in the current socio-economic environment and inside Europe. Well, a Magocracy would be much cooler but the fear to a new Voldemort forbids it, and I’m not ready (yet!) to be the president of a Technocracy  ;)\nThat said, back on track, now seriously. 2006. 3rd version of the Statute is approved in Catalonia and sent to Spanish Congress of Deputies, where it is approved. It wasn’t easy, too many politics involved, too much conflict and discrepancies, unwanted changes in the text and many more obstacles but it’s been done. Everything seems fine, but as you can imagine something went wrong or I would not be writing this. What went wrong is this:\n\nNovember 2nd, 2005: People’s Party does a recourse on the text of the Third Statue to the Constitutional Court of Spain. The party also does a recusatio of one member of the Tribunal, accusing him of being partial due to a study he did 8 years ago on the Catalan institutions. It’s the first time in history a recusatio in this court is accepted and applied, which means that the recused member won’t be able to decide in this subject.\nJanuary 26th, 2006: the recourse is accepted\nJuly 20th, 2006: the text, approved by Catalan Parliament, Spanish Congress and popular referendum, is published at BOE\nJuly 30th, 2006: People’s Party presents a recourse on more than half the text of the Statue to the Constitutional Court. And a second recusatio against the same judge against who they already had presented the previous one. It’s better to be on the safe side, you know?\n2006: many Spanish regions, most of them (but not all) governed by People’s Party, present a recourse to the text. The fact that some regions unrelated to People’s Party do that shows how much Spaniards care about us ;)\n2006-2007: many recusatio are done by the People’s Party and Catalan government against members of the Constitutional Court with opposite ideology. A purely political move to ensure the “proper” decision on the text. Only the recusatio done by People’s Party are accepted.\nMay 17th, 2008: one of the members of the Constitutional Court dies. The members which can decide are now 5 right wing members, 5 left wing members and the president, whose vote can decide only in case of a draw. At this time, many of the members of the court should have been replaced (according to the law) as their terms had expired time ago. The death should be covered by a new member.\nNovember 26th, 2009: still no decision by the court. Catalan press published a common editorial (the same in all media) rallying in favour of the text and its approval\nJuly 9th, 2010: 5 years after the text was created, 4 years after it was approved, the final version of the court’s decision is released. It requests many changes to the text, with the argumentation that they are against the Spanish Constitution. The tribunal is conformed by the same members it was in 2008. No replacement has come for the dead member, and no member has been replaced even when their terms expired long time ago according to legislation.\n\nThere are many details lost in here, that you could only understand if you lived in Spain. People’s Party is a right wing political party, which has made of its hate and attacks versus autonomous regions like Catalonia and Basque Country its flag. They didn’t complain at all against the Statute of Andalusia, another region of Spain governed by the other big party of Spain, PSOE. That text has similar wording (identical in some cases) to the Catalan one. In fact, People’s Party voted for it, approving it in the Congress.This and the already mentioned “legal issues” with the composition of the Constitutional Court are just some of many pieces that complete the jigsaw.\nThe relevant piece here is that the original text, created in 2005, was already modified (a lot) in 2006 by the Spanish Congress. And now they request even more changes. Thanks to political interests, the text is barely an improvement over the previous one. And they took 5 years to do all this. I wonder in which other developed country this would be accepted. 5 years to decide over the text, playing politics and breaking the national law about the composition of the Constitutional Court.\nIsn’t it nice?\nPast July 10th there was a demonstration in Barcelona to protest against he verdict of the court. According to the police 1,100,000 people gathered together in Barcelona to show their opposition to the decision of the court. Not bad at all. The biggest since 1978, and that one was for claiming the Second Statute after many years of dictatorship under Franco’s regime.\nOf course, some media and companies said quite a different number (56.000). Funny, as the next day (July 11th) Spain won the world cup, and the same company said 75.000 people had celebrated the achievement in Barcelona. Why it is funny? In this image you can see the areas covered by people each of the days (10th and 11th). Do your math. Oh, they justify themselves saying they measured at 20:30 (1 hour after the concentration had ended, perfect time!). It gives you an idea of the love of the media for Catalonia.\nUp to here, the facts. Yes, I’ve not been completely partial in the opinions, but the facts are real. You can check via the links provided or using Google and its translator if required. Go ahead and read about it, I’m waiting.\nWhat does it mean? What will happen?\nHonestly, I don’t believe a big change will happen. It’s been nice to see the people of Catalonia are still proud of their identity. Sadly we can’t trust our politicians, as they themselves started eroding the text by doing many changes to it in its trip to the Congress and back. Politics (both Catalan and Spanish) have played a big role against its success and the demonstration of last Saturday showed that. People complained against the politicians that were trying to reap some benefit from the event. It was nice to see :) Besides that, a pacific demonstration, no incidents involved.\nSo, no, I can’t say what will happen next. What I can say is that all these events are increasing unrest in Catalonia. The media broadcasted recently in TV a documentary named “Adeu Espanya” (Bye, Spain) where it showed how Catalonia could be if it was independent. The nationalist feelings, which were always there, are growing stronger by the day. Heck, even I, that usually ignored such stuff, I’m getting a feeling: “screw Madrid and Spain. No more federalism, let’s just break with them”. That should mean something to observers.\nI can’t argue if this is right or wrong, if the events are as they should be or not. I don’t even care who is right here. The only thing I know is that the way the text (and in extension, Catalan people) have been mistreated, it could not happen in any other country. Not in a country that calls itself “civilized”. Politic games are usually nasty. In this case, they have shown their darkest moves. They have left a sensation of failure in the people that elected them. If they don’t care about its people, why should the people care about them?\nWhat will happen now? Many people would say this. I’m not sure I want it. But, what other alternatives do we have?\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/estatut-de-catalunya-a-review/","title":"Estatut de Catalunya: a Review"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/executing-jasmine-tests-in-play-2-dot-0-4/":{"body":"Christmas break is over, and on a whim I started to check AngularJs. If you haven’t tested it yet, do it. I’ve toyed around  with Backbone and some other Javascript single page app frameworks, and Angular is by far the one that I liked the most. It has simplicity embedded in its core, and turning tedious tasks (as setting controllers) into something trivial makes it a pleasure to use. Simplicity. Such an important concept, and one which is seldom present in frameworks.\n\nBut I digress. Back to the post. Adding Angular to a Play app is as simple as you can imagine, as in the end it’s a Javascript library. Add the Angular files, code controllers and services, put Angular templates under public so Angular can get them, and you are done.  You can see a project sample in my Github account. Be aware the sample is very rough and has minimal functionality, the aim was to see how can they be linked, not to push Angular boundaries.\nSo we have a Javascript framework, and obviously we want to test it. Unfortunately the recommended way to test Angular is via Jasmine, a Javascript BDD framework. I say unfortunately because that would mean running 2 commands for testing: one for Play tests and another for Angular tests. Or does it?\nIt is on moments like this when Open Source shows its worthiness. Enter The Guardian and its Software development department, which open sources a lot of the code they create to run their online platform. A wise company, they use Scala and Play and they created Sbt-Jasmine, a plugin to run Jasmine inside Sbt projects. Given that Play 2 uses Sbt, this should prove simple.\nWell, to be honest it wasn’t so simple, that’s why I decided to document it here to save time to other interested people. This assumes a working Play 2.0.4 project, should work with any 2.0.x project but can’t promise anything about 2.1 (have to test it yet)\n\nIntegrating Sbt-Jasmine\nThis is quite straightforward, you just need to follow the instructions from the Sbt-Jasmine page. On your project, under the project folder, create another folder named project (that is, you will have /project/project/ path). Inside that new folder create a file Plugins.scala and add this code to it:\n\nThis will load the plugin directly from Github into your project.\n\nAdding Jasmine  as part of your test cycle\nNow that we have the plugin in, we want to be able to run both test types (Play and Jasmine) when executing play test. To that aim we have to edit our Build.scala project file to let Play know about Jasmine.\nThe first step will be importing the existing Jasmine settings the sbt plugin added into the project. We can do that via the PlayProject method settings, as in .settings(jasmineSettings : _*)\nThe second step is to override the default Jasmine configuration, specifically the paths that point to the test assets and source files. Sbt-Jasmine expects a set of default paths that don’t map to the ones existing in a Play project, so we change them as follows:\n\nNote that appJsDir is pointing to the folder for minimized assets, we could change that to point to \"public/Javascripts\". The paths for appJsLibDir, jasmineTestDir and jasmineConfFile can be modified as it suits you.\nThe Jasmine configuration file follows standard Jasmine notation, which I won’t discuss in this post. The configuration for this sample project is:\n\nFinally we need to tell Play to run Jasmine tests when executing the test command. We do this by adding a dependency on test with  (test in Test) &lt;&lt;= (test in Test) dependsOn (jasmine). This will cause Play to run first the Jasmine tests and, if they succeed, Play own tests will be executed.\nThe final code looks like:\n\nAnd that’s all. If you add some Jasmine tests under test/assets and then execute play test you will see them being run. Remember what I said about simplicity? Why should you remember to run 2 suits independently when 1 command can do that for you?\n\nTo be improved\nAs much as I would like, this is not perfect. I found a couple of issues when integrating Jasmine and Play. Given I’m not an expert on neither, any help will be appreciated:\n\n\nIn theory you could use RequireJS to import the Javascript sources to test, but it didn’t work when I tried. Not sure why and for a standard AngularJs distribution we are talking about 5 Javascript files (it could grow if you break them into components), so it doesn’t seem such a big deal. But it’s not perfect.\n\n\nAngularJs allows you to declare End to End test scenarios, similar to Selenium but inside AngularJs itself. Unfortunately I couldn’t make them work, as they require a server running. Given the enhanced Selenium support in newer AngularJS versions I expect one could use Play end to end scenarios to test this part, but I need to put more work on it to ensure it is true.\n\n\nIf anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know!\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/executing-jasmine-tests-in-play-2-dot-0-4/","title":"Executing Jasmine Tests in Play 2.0.4"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/finch-underscore-post/":{"body":"This is just a short entry to make you aware of a new post by yours truly at Underscore’s blog.\nMany thanks to Underscore for all the suggestions and review, and for publishing it.\nNow please go to Underscore’s blog and enjoy the post.

They use it as a recruitment tool (kind of, read their website) but it’s a very entertaining game, even if you are not looking for a new job.\n\nWhy am I talking about StockFighter? Well, as you can guess from the title, because Free Monads! Care to join?\n\nThe Mission\nStockFighter provides an environment which is limited in scope, but still complex enough that showcases limitations/strengths for a given tool. I’ve had in my backlog, for a looong while, the mission of completing the game. Building an API to do so using Free seemed like the perfect match.\nThe aim was to build a Free Monad wrapper on top of the Stockfighter API, using Freek, which allows us to solve the levels of the game. The API would only focus on the Trading part of the game as the other component, Jailbreak, is not fully ready to be used.\n\nCaveats\nBefore we start, I want to make you aware that I am a beginner regarding Free. I’ve heard a lot about the subject, and I previously wrote two posts about them: Free Monad and Freek and Free Monads as a result of my research around the concept.\nBut these posts approached the subject in a very theoretical way; they described how to build a Free Monad and potential applications, but you don’t really understand something until you have used it in production or, at least, in a realistic environment.\nThis is my first real(ish) experience using Free for something more than a proof of concept, and as such I may have missed something obvious. If you believe so, please contact me via twitter (@pvillega) as I’m very keen on fixing gaps in my knowledge :)\n\nThe Implementation\nReleasing your code to the public is scary, isn’t it? Oh, well, here you have it. The code took longer than I wanted, as during its conception I realised several misconceptions I had regarding Free Monads and their implementation. I also experimented a bit with unrelated stuff which delayed this post slightly more. Ah, shiny baubles…\nYou may want to start by opening Introduction.scala and reading it top to bottom, as it exposes the API and usage cases.\nIf we ignore all the stuff not purely related to Free Monads, there are three files to focus on: LogApi.scala, TradeApi.scala, and TradingAppHelpers.scala.\n\nThe Free Monads\nFiles LogApi.scala and TradeApi.scala implement the Free Monads for the library. I won’t enter into the implementation details as they should be straightforward, and you can refer to my previous post on Freek for guidance.\nWhat I want to discuss is: why these two DSL and not more?\nWe can argue about the abstraction levels, but I’ve come to these two as a natural evolution of the API. My initial idea was to build everything based on Free. When I say everything I mean it: my http calls would be a Free DSL (Get, Post, etc). Logs? Free. Free all the way down (and then turtles). It even sounded easy: Freek examples showcase a Log and Http DSL, so why not?\nWell, it may be possible, in fact it’s my next aim (v 2.0?) to experiment more around this area. But it makes things more complex than needed.\nLet’s take an example: Http DSL. Given the way natural transformations work, and that you want a generic DSL, you’ll end up with two DSL for your Http calls: a request one and one to manage responses. This is ok, the problem comes when you want to start defining TradeAPI using these DSL.\nA natural transformation converts a monad into another. Although Free is a monad, I had lots of problems trying to compile a Natural transformation from TradeApi.DSL to Task that internally used Http.DSL, as it wasn’t a one-to-one transformation, but a one-to-for-comprehension transformation. It just didn’t work.\nThe easy solution was to implement the calls in TradeApi as for-comprehensions that used Http.DSL to define the behaviour. So buy would call the corresponding Http.DSL helpers, and so on. Something like:\n\nAt this point, though, we won’t have an interpreter for TradeAPI, only for Http.DSL. And there may be scenarios where we want to go that path. But, in this one, we may as well use our own interpreter for TradeAPI that manages the http calls and decoding inside, like a black box. We end up using a single interpreter anyway, but a slightly saner one.\nLogApi survived because, despite the option of doing the logging within the interpreter, it makes sense to allow the user to document the intention of programs built using TradeAPI.\nSo, in the end, we only need these two. Yes, we could go deeper and replace TradeAPI by several lower-level API, but the current form seemed simpler and more usable.\n\nHelper class\nTradingAppHelpers.scala is mostly support methods and declarations: it defines the Onion we will use in our program, as well as some common methods like run to abstract calling the interpreter for our program and managing the lifecycle of our http client (to avoid leaking connections). I believe the comments in the file suffice to explain the intentions.\nThere are three parts of its code I want to elaborate a bit on.\n\nOnion type\nBelow we have the declaration for API and Onion, as usual when using Freek to work with several DSL at once.\n\nNote that the Onion declaration, O, includes both Result (an alias to Xor) and List. Without adding List I could not make it compile with result types of the form Result[List[A]].\nThe side effect of this is that using the Onion causes all the programs to return Result[List[A]] results. We can avoid this if we know we won’t use a call that return Result[List[A]] inside a program. In that case we may avoid the Onion and obtain just Result[A] at the end (using .freek and not .freeko), but I’ve provided no helper methods similar to run for this use case. Feel free to send a pull-request with one ;)\nThere’s a better discussion on the matter in this issue.\n\nTask Interpreter\nOur Task interpreter, the natural transformation from the DSL to Task, is declared as:\n\nIn this implementation TradeApiTaskInterpreter depends on an httpClient to be able to contact Stockfighter. Encapsulating the httpClient inside the interpreter is problematic, as we can’t control the lifecycle of the client itself. At no point during the natural transformation are you aware that this is the last step (unless you add an explicit last step command, but kind of defeats the point). Which means that closing your http connections needs to be done outside the interpreter itself.\nI know it sounds obvious, and it is. But the examples I’ve seen regarding interpreters and natural transformations showcase them as static objects with no dependencies, although the interpreters are the areas where we will perform side effects, like an http request. This mislead me, initially, to try to encapsulate everything inside the interpreter itself. I’m open to suggestions on improving the code, if you believe there’s a better way to manage the client.\n\nRun the Onion\nThe code to run an interpreter on a given Onion is always the same, which means we can abstract it:\n\nAs you can see the function run instantiates its own TradeApiTaskInterpreter to manage the httpClient, as discussed in the previous section.\nThe relevant part of this code is the type of the parameter program: OnionT[Free, API.Cop, O, A]. It’s another obvious thing, but when I tried to generalise the signature from my existing programs the values sbt gave me didn’t compile properly due to several implicit-related errors. Freek uses quite a few of them implicits, and you can find yourself in a tangle trying to derive the implicit you need for your program. Next time, just copy this method’s signature.\nOr, as I discovered a bit too late (to my chagrin) pay more attention when reading the Freek instructions. That type is declared in the Readme file. D’oh!\n\nThe case for Freek\nI want to explicitly comment on Freek, as it deserves all praise I can give it.\nMy experience building these monads is a vindication for the library. Honestly, if you are going to use Free Monads in your code, add it to your dependencies. Right now. I’ll wait. Done?\nI tried the Cats approach I described in my old post about Free Monad to implement the API, stubborn in keeping it simple and using few dependencies. The pain was real, oh so real, when trying to work with the different answer types the DSL provides.\nIn fact, it didn’t work. Without Freek, the compiler was beating me. No chances, full surrender.\nYes, it is not perfect. For example see this issue related to the return types of Onions. It’s slightly cumbersome to having to manually peel responses each time you use the Onion. But given the alternative, I found it perfectly acceptable. And, come on, it’s barely version 0.6.0 and improving fast!\nIf you are a Scala magician at the level of Pascal, Travis, or Miles you may not need it. Otherwise, just use it and spend your valuable time in something else.\n\nWhat are Free Monads for\nBased on the, arguably limited, experience I’ve had while building the API and running programs using it there are several things to consider when using Free.\n\nFree Monads are for API\nFree Monads are intended to abstract your API. You define your DSLs, you build a program that uses them, and your construct interpreters to match. They are not for doing business logic, though.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWhen I read about them, my naive mind thought you could buy a stack of Free on top of Free and only at the end you’d use the interpreter, creating a kind of pure universe untouched by side effects. Crazy, maybe.\nLet’s start by the fact that Free doesn’t (can’t?) implement filter. This removes the capability of using if statements inside your for-comprehension. At some point in your application you’ll need to make decisions based on results, and avoiding filter gets complicated, fast.\nFor example, using the API provided try to create a program that buys a stock if the quote is lower than a value, and otherwise sells but only if you have enough shares and doing so would generate a benefit. Most likely you will end up with programs that mix Free statements with non-Free statements. You may argue the API is limited, so how complex do you want it to become to cover all particular once-off cases?\nSo, Free is great when you define a contract to hide implementation details. Think interfaces that do IO behind the scenes, or other side-effects, or combine calls to several services in one go. But it’s doubtful you’ll build your application (unless trivial) with only Free.\n\nDDD ready\nDDD is popular and you most likely use it. Bounded contexts and ubiquitous languages are a great fit for Free.\nYour context is defined by a contract, an API that other components will use. Your logic will often use more than one context to achieve something, for example communicating with Authentication, User data, and Image storage to get the information it needs. Free are perfectly suited for this task.\n\nInterpreters are your IO Monad\nI hear somebody screaming due to this statement. Apologies! But, in a sense, your interpreters can be considered a black box that will have side effects inside, which you don’t care much about.\nYour Free programs define steps to be done against a certain API, but nothing else. They are pure, no side effects, nothing, just a list of steps. Only when interpreted is when they really do something useful.\nThis means all the side effects happen in your interpreter. And that is good. We want to isolate side-effects in our codebases, but when trying to do so we may end up with some cumbersome stuff:\n\nThis is your return type: Int.\nThis is your return type on microservices: IO (Logger (Either HttpError Int))\n\nCredit to Kris Jenkins\n\n\nJokes aside, we want to push side effects to the boundaries, which means we get horrible return types piling Task on top of Writer on top of Xor on top of any other monad we found. Within the interpreter we don’t need that. We know things will happen there, we can be ok with logging and running an IO fest within that black box. Because it’s isolated, and won’t leak, and we run it at the end, anyway.\nAnd we get a cleaner return type as a consequence.\n\nInterpreters should be your test target\nIn the codebase you’ll see a blunder I realised too late. Initially I tried to test programs by using an accumulating interpreter that stored the calls to the api in a State monad, returning some default values. This allowed me to compare expected output of the program vs the real output.\nThe accumulating interpreter can be good to see what happens with a program (print all the calls, to the bottom of the stack), but it’s not a great fit for testing due to hardcoded values. I experimented with another interpreter that allowed me to mock expected responses, so I could test most complex values, but this wasn’t ideal nor satisfactory.\nThen I realised I was approaching it wrong.\nWithout Free, what I’d usually do is test a method for expected outputs given certain input. And that’s what I tried to do here. But with Free your method is nothing. I mean, it’s a description, so the test will be fully tangled with the program you defined.\nWhat you want to test is the interpreter, or its core. You want to make sure the output for a given DSL call is what you expect. In our scenario, TradeApiTaskInterpreter uses a client to to http calls. The return types are enforced during compilation of the DSL (we know a call to buy will return an object of a certain type), but we may want to guarantee we are passing values like price or quantity correctly, or that if the http client returns an error we are capturing it and returning the proper Left.\nThis is where we want to focus our test efforts, which incidentally reduces the surface of code to be tested a lot, arguably giving us much robust code. Of course, there will be methods that mix Free monads with logical statements (if x call this monad, otherwise the other) which you will want to test as usual. But for methods that only use Free, focus on testing the interpreters.\n\nBeware the layers\nI talked about it when discussing why I implemented the two DSL I chose, but it’s worth repeating.\nRemember that your interpreter (as a natural transformation) has limitations. Start with the top level API and consider if you need a lower level DSL for your purposes. It may be, as in our case, that a single layer is good enough. It may as well be that you have a case that justifies building your Free on a lower layer.\nIn any case, stacking Free is not trivial and may cause pain. Thread carefully.\n\nThey are not easy\nPeople talking about Free mention they are not easy and that new teams (or teams without much experience in functional programming) should not adopt them directly. I realised I didn’t fully understand the warning when I started using them for this library. They seem easy, they are misleadingly so. But you will find yourself scratching your head many, many times, due to subtleties that arise when using them.\nDon’t underestimate them.\n\nAims achieved?\nI have to make a confession: I’ve not completed StockFighter. I got sidetracked while experimenting with the API  using their test server, so I’ve only solved the first (and trivial) level. Someday I’ll finish it :) I failed that aim.\nBut it’s been an enlightening experiment, which made me realise the limitations and strengths of Free. That said, it’s a first step on the path and most likely in a few months I’ll revisit this and realise I was wrong. But, hey, learning. Or something ;)\nSo, yes, Free Monad are useful, but they are no silver bullet. What a surprise, isn’t it? Like everything else in IT.\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful.

The same day I published it I discovered FreeK by Pascal Voitot. How does FreeK help you when building a Free Monad?\n\nI’ve updated my code on Free Monad with a sample using FreeK. The sample contains my previous implementation which only used Cats Free implementation, so you can compare both side by side.\nI can say upfront that FreeK removed a bit of boilerplate and made the implementation slightly cleaner. I feel the main benefit of FreeK is not so much the Free Monad tooling (which, don’t misunderstand me, is good!) but it’s integration with monad transformers, as well as the way it manages what Pascal calls monadic onions of result types.\n\nImplementing Free with FreeK\nThe first step is, as expected, to define our languages. I assume (from now onwards) that you have read my previous post so I won’t discuss details already tackled in there.\nWith FreeK we define our language like this:\n\nwhich is no different as how we were doing it before; a trait with case classes. The convention of calling the trait DSL and embedding it in the object is one I’ll use from now on, but it’s not exclusive of FreeK, can be used without it.\nAn interpreter is defined as:\n\nwhich, again, is an alternative to the way we were defining interpreters before. Not FreeK exclusive, but nicer :)\nSo let’s define the rest of our languages:\n\nOk, languages defined. Next, let’s define our Free type (or Coproduct for multiple types)\n\nThe Free/Coproduct type\nIn here is where FreeK provides the first big improvement. FreeK contains a specialised implementation of Shapeless Coproduct for higher-kinded structures. The result is that we can define a type that includes several languages in one go, instead of having to create the chain of Coproduct we built in the previous post.\nWith FreeK you use the same syntax for a Free that includes one or several languages:\n\nInterpreters get a similar benefit. You can leverage FreeK specific syntax to easily compose interpreters from multiple languages. The only restrictions are:\n\nthe interpreters must all be transformations to the same Monad (as with any composition of Natural Transformations, nothing new here)\nthey must be declared in the same order the types are defined in our PRG declaration.\n\n\nWith this we have our free type and the interpreter. That was easy! We just need the program to execute, and we are done.\n\nThe program\nIf you have noticed, in the previous post we created some kind of support methods that lifted our case classes to a Free Monad. But this time we have not built anything similar. So, how are we going to use our case classes in a for-comprehension?\nThe answer is given by *FreeK and a support method appropriately called freek[A]. Let’s see an example of its usage by replicating the logic in our original program:\n\nAs you can see we are using the case classes we defined with our languages, directly. The magic happens within the freek[PRG] call, which lifts our case class to a Free Monad of the Coproduct defined by PRG.\nWe have replaced support methods using Free.liftF or Inject with this call, which some people may argue is not a huge benefit, code wise. Personally, I believe it’s a big win as we have less clutter around our languages, where now we just see case classes and interpreters, and all the extra syntax is located within the program itself. Also, adding new languages is much simpler. What’s not to like?\nWe can execute this program to verify it works:\n\nOh, by the way, remember that program that was returning a List inside the monad, and thus required the use of traverse? Yes, we can also implement it using FreeK:\n\nWe still need the traverseU trick, but it works the same, as freek[PRG] returns a monad an that fits the signature of traverseU. So we can port our programs, we are not losing any core functionality by using FreeK.\n\nOrders via Messages\nThe last use case explored in the previous post was to define Orders as a set of Messaging operations, by chaining natural transformations from Orders, to Messaging, and to Id. Can we do this with FreeK? Let’s start by defining a new interpreter from Orders to Messaging:\n\nNext step, let’s integrate this interpreter into the interpreter chain we defined before. To do this, we need to replace OrderInterpreter by a composition of the new interpreter (from Orders to Messaging) and the existing interpreter from Messaging to Id:\n\nand then we run our program:\n\nIt works, so it seems we can do what we expected! Can’t we?\nWell, the astute reader (i.e.: one that has read up to this point… congratulations!) will notice that in our previous implementation we were using a for-comprehension in OrdersToMessagesInterpreter for the case of ListStocks. As we are working with case classes directly, not with monads, we can’t build the for-comprehension.\nI’ve tried to work around it by creating some additional types to lift the classes via freek[A], so we can have the same code as before, but it’s become a bit verbose which means that, most likely, I’m doing something wrong :) Just be aware this use case may require a bit more effort than the others.\n\nIn summary\nI like FreeK, as it simplifies working with Free Monads. There may be a couple of scenarios which need either more work or a better understanding of the library, but in general it seems like a robust solutions. Let’s not forget it also provides utilities to mix monad transformers with our Free monads, which will solve several pains related to monad stacks.\nSo if you want to use Free monads in our code, please give Freek a go :)\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful.

Unfortunately the golden times of the 80’s where simplistic games with almost no graphics succeeded are gone. Music, graphics, story… nowadays a decent game requires lots of manpower. But is that dream over?\n\nFortunately technology advances fast. Very fast. If the complexity of games has increased, so has the capabilities of game development tools. For example, Unity3D, a game engine used by plenty of successful games that streamlines the process to a huge degree. No, a single developer won’t build the next Clash of Clans but it’s much easier for a small team to do so.\nI tried Unity a few years ago (when Unity 3.x was offered for free) but, somehow, I never spent much time to it. I forgot about it until recently, when I ended up with a link to a very good tutorial (warning: it’s in Spanish) and I decided I’d implement something by following it.\nAnd, indeed, I did. I started yesterday morning and in less than 48 hours my game is available in the Google Play store. Granted: it’s buggy, not original and very silly. But I built it, so I’ll overlook all those truths for a while if you don’t mind me doing so. It’s my baby-game ;)\nI also uploaded the source to Github. I deviated a bit from the tutorial (nothing major), so feel free to use it as a template to experiment with.\nDoes this mean I’ll drop everything and become a game developer? Not really.

This simple and straightforward fact always raises expressions of incredulity amongst the people I meet here in Dublin when I tell them I live here:\n\n…“What are you doing here?”\n…“Don’t you miss the sun?”\n…“How could you leave?”.\nThings become more complicated when they start speaking about football and I have to confess I’m a follower of Manchester United and I don’t like FC Barcelona… Yes, it is complicated…\nTruth be told, when I left Barcelona almost 3 years ago now (time flies!) I really disliked the city. I found myself in a country (Spain) where the moral is too … let’s call it grey-ish, with a career (IT) underpaid and undervalued, in a region (Catalonia) hated by the other regions of the country. I truly believed the environment was unbearable. I despised it, reason why I chose United as my club, I read only in English, and so on. I just wanted to see Europe, the golden land beyond the northern hills of the country. I wanted to leave.\nIt wasn’t until I landed in Dublin that I started to become aware of the fact that my city, Barcelona, is great. It all started with the people here. If I had to say which nation loves Barcelona the most it wouldn’t be Catalonia, but Ireland. I can’t say how many people have explained to me how much did they enjoy their trips there, and their future plans to go back. It seems like the whole island has visited it at one time or another!\nHonestly, this came as a surprise. Hearing so many good things about your city makes you wonder: maybe I was mistaken. And time always enforces the good memories, so as months went on in Dublin, the memories of Barcelona became more partial, leaning towards the good ones, smoothing the bad ones. From time to time I did the mistake of reading a Spanish newspaper and then the old thoughts (fuck off Spain!) came back, at least for a while.\nThen I met Ewa, that polish girl that would become my fiancee, and I still remember her face when I answered to her standard “Where are you from?” with “Barcelona, and you?”. I remember when I brought her to Barcelona for the first time, it was like giving the best present in the world to a child. And in that visit I was in places I had never been, and I saw a city I had never seen. A refreshing view of a place I had ignored for so long while living in it.\nI don’t lie to myself. Barcelona is far from perfect, specially when you compare it with cities like Munich or New York. But I can agree that it is good enough, and that it has its charm. That it may lack some things, important ones, but it has others to compensate. That I’ve learned to understand it and appreciate it. And that, probably, if I had never left it I would still not see her cuteness. The one it has, even knowing the ugly that comes with it.\nSo I can only say: I’m from Barcelona.

Creating a tiny for-fun project allows me to see that functionality in action, to solve the initial pitfalls related to it and to have a basic sample for later on.\n\nWith Play 2.1 coming closer, and seeing all the new stuff in it (Slick, Scala 2.10, etc) I wanted to test some of the features that I’ve not been able to use in a “real project”, especially the ones related to Real Time web. When thinking about what to implement I remembered an issue a friend had in his company, an ETL-like process that had to receive data (massive amounts) on one end and store it in several location after processing the data. While not in the mood to create a real system which would be quite complex, having to manage queues and ensuring messages were delivered, that inspired me to plan a minor project in which I could use several interesting technologies: Iteratee, MongoDB, Redis and Akka actors. I’ve not used any of them very often, so I was sold to the idea :)\nYou can find the code resulting from this experiment in my Github repository.\nI won’t start a line-by-line description of the project, the source is there and I believe it’s quite self-explanatory. But there are some things that are worth mentioning, even if it is just for future reference:\n\n\nEnumerator.imperative allows you to push data into the Enumerator manually and won’t close the stream until you say so. I had problems when trying to implement a Html view on the stream, as a non-imperative stream was closing automatically once the data was consumed, not waiting for the next input which was slower than the rate at which the app consumed the Enumerator.\n\n\nSSE is great, very performing and with better support than WebSockets. Also, the fact that the browser automatically restores the connection if the link is dropped simplifies the code a lot. But (always a but!) it has a bug in its implementation in Play 2.0.4 where the events won’t have an Id associated even if you provide the corresponding extractor. Hopefully that will be solved in 2.1. The event name part works, though!\n\n\nConcurrent.hub has a nice trick with the getPatchCord method where you multiplex the stream to several clients at the same time. Saves a lot of memory and CPU.\n\n\nAkka actors are as simple, fast and reliable as always. As a veteran Java developer, seeing Actors makes it very very hard to go back to synchronized and all that clutter\n\n\nThe combination Iteratee + Actor + MongoDB is FAST. When running a test with simulated request every 10ms my computer (a bit old by nowadays standards) didn’t notice it at all. Low resource consumption and high speed? Go Play!\n\n\nTalking about MongoDB, I’ve never been a huge fan of NoSQL and in the past I read many articles which made me doubt about Mongo. Obviously, this is not a real-life system where I can’t afford to lose data, but it was refreshing to see the simplicity of the approach Mongo takes to storing and retrieving data. With ReactiveMongo and Play 2.1 it may be a wonderful support system for non-critical real-time data.\n\n\nRedis as a Memcached replacement is good, very good, but the additional methods provided by the API so you can use it as a key store can be a bit confusing. I can’t say which one is better (Redis or Memcached) but I’m quite impressed with Redis.\n\n\nNot much more to add. Feel free to clone the code and play with it. It’s nothing amazing as code goes, but it shows what you can achieve with just a few lines of Scala and Play :)\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/iteratees-and-play-2/","title":"Iteratees and Play 2"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/its-back/":{"body":"It’s been a while, but the domain is live again!

For a while I wanted to do something more personal than a simple “out-of-the-shelf” blog. I don’t post regularly enough as to have a blog. I post by whim, when I see something interesting or when I feel I should share something. I was using the “blog” mostly as a storage place for links and documentation.

The official announcement is here. A list of the new additions to our beloved JVM follows:\n\n\nBinary literals: from now on basic numeric types (byte, short, int, long) can be specified as binary numbers using the prefix 0b or 0B\nUnderscores in literals: for readability purposes now we can use underscores to mark numbers. You can put them in any place that helps you to read the number better.\nTry with resource: Previously when using some resources like Streams you had to add a finally block just to close it. Now with this new construct Java will close the resource once the try-catch block finishes, either normally or via an exception.\nMultiple Exception Caching: a code saver, from now on the catch clauses accept several exceptions in one clause, avoiding code duplication when several exceptions should be treated the same way. The operator | is used for this.\nBetter exception analysis on declaration: this seems a bit confusing but it’s simple. If you do a catch Exception, your throws clause in the declaration can still declare very specific exceptions (like IllegalArgumentException). Java will verify that all non-runtime exceptions you generate can only be of the types declared in throws. This allows you to declare better interfaces for error management.\nStrings in Switch: something that was really needed, now you can use Strings as a parameter in the switch statement. Probably is still safer to use enumerations for this, but there are scenarios in which a String-switch is handy.\nType inference: albeit limited when you compare to Scala’s inference, now we have type inference for Generics. This means less typing as you only need to declare the Generic in the left side of the expression.\nNew compiler warnings on varargs: when using Generics in varargs parameters the compiler will raise new warnings to notify about the possible issues this may cause.\nInvokeDynamic for non-Java languages: this goes directly into the JVM ecosystem, and it should be a big improvement for languages like Scala. Not something the average Joe programmer will use, but we will feel it on our daily work.\nImprovements on NIO library: never used it too much, but I guess they will be exciting for some people :)\nNew UI components: a new component, JLayerPanel, has been added. Not much of a Swing guy here, so not much to say.\n\nI may be missing something, but these are the more relevant ones.

It only gives basic information, for more details about life cycle and other functionalities check the EJB 3.0 reference or some book like EJB3 in Action.\n\nPersistence is probably one of the biggest concerns of most enterprise applications. Data is key and we have to be sure it’s consistent and our application can manage its changes properly. To that end lots of alternatives have been developed, with O/R mapping systems taking the led in the latest years due to the benefits of using an intermediate API that’s closer to the OO model used in the business layer instead of direct interaction with the RDBMS.\nEJB entities are the answer of EJB 3,0 to the persistence issue and it’s implementation using JPA follows the same basic patterns as other components like session beans. That means they are POJOs with specific annotations (@Entity for JPA entities) that are capable of inheritance and whose non-abstract classes requires a public or protected no-argument constructor.\nJPA is the most complex part of EJB 3.0. Not only controls the most critical component of our application but it provides a large number of options for a developer to be able to adapt it to his needs. I will try to break this complexity in some sections, like they do in the book EJB in Action, focussing on a few aspects of JPA. Remember this is just a quick summary that won’t cover lots of aspects of JPA.\n\nBasic domain concepts: entities and primary keys\nAs said above JPA is an O/R mapping system. That means it maps Java POJOs (objects) to data stored in the database as tables and rows (relational data). To achieve this JPA does a heavy use of annotations. In this section I will show basic POJOs with some common annotations and explain how they are used. That will enables us to map our tables to the application, although by itself it won’t let our application work. Let’s start with a basic entity:\n\nIn this example we can see some interesting characteristics of an entity. First one, the entity is marked with the @Entity annotation, that identifies this POJO as an EJB 3,0 entity. Another important step is to override the methods hashcode, equals and toString. This is not mandatory but it’s considered a best practice to implement hashcode and equals so they use our primary key to identify our entity, and changing toString allows us to log and debug the application easily.\nThe persistence provider will store the values of any property or field that has public or protected setters and getters, which can’t be declared final, so no especial annotation is required to enable their persistence. In this example you can see we use a @Transient annotation in one field. This is equivalent to the transient keyword related to Serialization and tells the persistence manager to not persist that specific field.\nAnother detail about the annotations: in this example they are on the fields of the classes. You could write them on the getter methods of those fields, but whatever system you choose you have to stick to it for all you entities. The only difference is that using field-annotation you could make your fields public and not use any getter or setter method and they would be persisted, while using the annotation in the getter method obliges you to implement all the getters/setters and make the field private. Given that the first way is a very dangerous and bad practice, so you will have a private field with getter and setters in your entities, choosing one over the other is usually a matter of taste.\nI’ve left the @Id annotation for last. This annotation, as you can guess, tells the entity where is stored our unique id. The field that can be marked as Id has some restrictions: it must be a primitive, its wrapper or a Serializable type. Types like double or float are forbidden due to their lack of precision (due to the way computers work, you should know what I mean) and that could cause two different entities to be considered the same.\nBut the @Id annotation is marking only one field and we can’t have more than one @Id in our class, so what happens if we have a primary key that uses several fields? There are two approaches to it.\nThe first approach uses the @IdClass annotation as follows:\n\nAs you can see we have our main entity class with several @Id fields assigned and a related class that contains the same fields. In this case we implement the equals and hashcode methods in the PK class, not in our entity. With this approach the container will use the entity to persist data and will map internally the fields to the PK class, which will be used when it needs to compare two entities.\nThe other alternative is the use of the @EmbeddedId annotation, like this:\n\nThe skeleton is quite similar to the @IdClass one but in this case instead of having the primary key fields on both classes, we just put them in our PK class, and we embed that class into our entity as its primary key. Choosing between any of those methods is a matter of personal taste: one is harder to maintain due to replication, the other makes access to PK fields more awkward. Keep in mind that although you can use those structures sometimes is preferable the use of a surrogate key (we will review it later) as Id, as it will free you code from extra classes and it has better performance.\nNow that we have talk about the @Embeddable annotation it might be a good time to explain its meaning. In our data model we may have some data that’s always related to a certain object but that has sense by itself, like the address of a user. This address contains several fields (city, street) so it may be an entity but it’s always related to a user. So in the object model it makes sense to implement it as its own object but in the relational model it will be in the same table as the user. To solve this JPA has the option to embed objects into entities, allowing us to declare this kind of relationship. An example:\n\n\nBasic domain concepts: entities relationships\nThe data components in our model will have some kind of relationships between them: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many. These relationships must be defined in our entities so the persistence provider can maintain the proper relations and the data consistency. In this section I will describe the annotations that manage that.\nFirst one is the @OneToOne annotation, that defines a one-to-one relationship.This relationship can be unidirectional or bidirectional. Let’s start with a bidirectional one:\n\nIn this example we see the relation defined by the annotations in the parameters. Each class contain a parameter of the class that represents the entity related to it marked with @OneToOne. Notice that VisaInfoEntity adds some parameters to it’s annotation, telling the persistence provider that the “owner” of the relation is the UserEntity class and which field is leading that mapping. The optional parameter set to false tells us there will always be a VisaInfoEntity for each user and a user for each VisaInfoEntity. If we want to convert this to a unidirectional link we just need to remove the reference to UserEntity and its annotation from VisaInfoEntity. With that the container will know our UserEntity may have zero or one VisaInfoEntity related to it.\nThe second type of relation is defined by the annotations @OneToMany and @ManyToOne. Those annotations usually go in pair to define both sides of the relation one-to-many. Usually in these relations one entity has a field of type Set or List of the other entity. One example:\n\nAs you can see the owning part of the relation is VisaInfoEntity. In these type of relations the many-to-one part is always the leader, something to be aware of.\nLast type of relations is defined by the annotation @ManyToMany. The relation is quite similar to the one-to-many explained above, but we can choose which entity is leading the relationship. An example:\n\n\nMapping entities to DB\nWe know how to build entities and define relations between them. Now we need to map those entities to the tables of the database, as we will see next. Before looking at the example, be aware that using annotations for that purpose hard-codes the structure, so any changes to it will require a new version of the application. This is usually not a big deal but if you need to be able to change the mappings without compiling, use the XML descriptor version of the fields.\nNext there’s an example of a mapped entity. The meaning of the annotations is quite obvious, I will comment them after the code:\n\nThe first annotation which we must pay attention to is @Table. This annotation specifies which table contains the columns we will use for the entity. If not specified (both the name or the tag) the system will use a table with the same name as the class.\nThe @Column annotation declares the mapping to a column of the table. As you can see, accepts some extra parameters to indicate if the field can be null or it can be modified using update or insert. The persistence manager assumes the columns exist in the class table, but you can specify another table if needed as you can see at the picture field. As with the @Table annotation, if you don’t define the name of the column or you8 don’t add the annotation it will be assumed the column has the same name as the field.\nThere are some extra annotations for specific types of data. The @Enumerated annotation allows us to store enumerations. We can use two modes: Ordinal or String. The first will store the integer associated to the enumeration value while the second will store the complete string.\nThe @Lob annotation tell the manager this field will be stored in a CLOB (for char[] or String fields) or BLOB (any other type) column in the database. Usually you add the @Basic annotation to a @Lob object to enable lazy loading, as @Lob objects are usually very memory intensive.\nThe @Temporal allows us to store date-related information. By default it uses a granularity of timestamp, but we can choose between DATE, TIME or TIMESTAMP.\nFor the primary key of the application you may use (if it’s a surrogate key) the @GeneratedValue annotation. This annotation will tell the persistence manager the field’s value is generated by the database. That means it will only exist once the entity has been committed, so we careful when accessing items not committed yet as they will have a null here.\nThe @GeneratedValue annotation has 4 available strategies to assign the value. The simplest one is IDENTITY and assigns an incremental value to the key. The second one is SEQUENCE, that requires a sequence to be defined both in the database and in EJB (using @SequenceGenerator). The third one is TABLE, which uses a a table as generator of the values (with @TableGenerator). The last strategy is AUTO, where the persistence manager decides which one is the best strategy.\nI have skipped an annotation in the class header, @SecondaryTable. This one is used when we need to map an entity to several tables, in this case because we store the BLOB object in another table. As you can see, we tell the annotation which table it has to use and the name of join field. You can use several secondary tables in the same entity. Although this annotation doesn’t seem so useful, it allows you to distribute content on several tables, which can improve the performance of the RDBMS as it happens in this example where the BLOB would slow queries done to the user table. That said be aware that this annotation is not the same as @Embedded, which we saw before and refers to content in the same table.\nAs you look at the code, you might wonder if maybe we need to specify join keys for tables relationship as we did in the @SecondaryTable annotation. The answer is yes, there are some annotations (three) to that end. I will briefly comment them:\n\n@JoinColumn: this annotation allows you to specify primary/foreign relations in the database model, when the referencing entity has a primary key and the referenced entity it’s own primary key and a foreign key mapped to the primary key of the referencing entity. It can be used in one-to-one and one-to-many/many-to-one relations.\n@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn: this annotation allows you to specify primary/foreign relations in the database model when both referencing and referenced entities share the primary key of the referencing table and the referenced table uses it’s primary key as foreign key. It can be used in one-to-one relations.\n@JoinTable: this annotation allows you to specify primary/foreign relations in the database model when you have a many-to-many relation so you need to use an intermediate table to store the mappings. Is used in conjunction with the @JoinColumn annotation to specify the relation between the main tables and the intermediate one.\n\nOne last subject to talk about is how to map inheritance. As we said, JPA are POJO and they can use OO characteristics as inheritance, but how can we write that into the database? I won’t enter in too much detail, but to this aim we have the @Inheritance annotation. It has 3 related strategies:\n\nSingle table: all data of the different subclases will be stored in the same table and we use one column (specified in the @DiscriminatorColumn annotation) to differentiate between subclasses. Each subclass will be marked with @DiscriminatorValue to tell the persistence manager which value maps to that type of entity.\nJoined Tables: we use one-to-one relations to model the inheritance. @DiscriminatorColumn and @DiscriminatorValue are used the same way but we also need to define the @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn between the tables. Is the recommended method.\nTable per class: we use one table per class, including one for the parent entity. No relations must be defined, and the inherited columns are duplicated across tables.Due to possible issues with polymorphism and entity retrieving, is not recommended to use this method\n\n\nEntity Manager\nWe’ve seen how to map the entities to the database, but you’ll probably noticed I said nothing about how the entities are persisted. This section will talk about the Entity Manager, the interface responsible of all CRUD operations that allows you to retrieve and store entities from/into the database. An important consequence of this is that JPA being managed by this interface and not the container they don’t have access to services like injection, timers, etc. It’s not a big loose due to the way entities are (commonly) used but it’s something to be aware of. I won’t talk about the lifecycle in detail, just keep in mind the Entity Manager is only aware of entities in it’s context (that can be as short as a method call or as long as a session), and an entity is not managed until you persist it.\nA basic demonstration of the use of the Entity Manager follows. I won’t comment the code as it’s quite obvious:\n\nThere’s a scenario that we must discuss in more detail. We may have an entity that contains another entity (maybe in a one-to-one relation) and both are new entities not stored (yet) in the database. Although it seems a logic behaviour that when we persist the enclosing entity both are saved into the database, this is not the default behaviour. This is justified as cascading can be resource intensive when propagating to several instances, and probably most of them have not been modified which means we are wasting resources.\nThis functionality is defined by the “cascade” property that you can set when declaring relationships between entities (@OneToOne, etc). By default this property is empty so no persistence operation applied to one entity is propagated to related entities. You can change this by setting cascade to one of these values: MERGE, PERSIST, REFRESH, REMOVE or ALL. The first four tell the Entity Manager to propagate only the selected operation while the last one propagates all the persistence operations.\n\nQuery API\nThe query API is a mechanism that allows you to find entities using SQL or JPQL, hiding the datasource behind the Entity Manager. It’s a complement to the find method that allows you to recover several related entities a once. It allows for two kind of queries: named and dynamic.\nNamed queries are intended to be stored and reused, allowing for some optimizations. They are defined at class level and can receive parameters, and one entity may have several named queries. Using named queries you can isolate the SQL/JPQL from the places where is used, making it more maintainable. You may even define them in xml descriptors, decoupling them from the code.\nAn example of a named query would be:\n\nDynamic queries are generated “on the fly”, usually queries received from some other component. When possible is recommended to work with named queries, due to the performance enhancements they allow. En example of a dynamic query:\n\n\nJPQL and SQL\nJPA accepts both JPQL and SQL for queries. Although they look quite similar, SQL works with the relational environment while JPQL works with entities, thus behaving in quite a different way behind the curtain. The recommendation for JPA is to use JPQL always, unless some odd exception requires us to use SQL.\nI wont enter in details about JPQL as a brief tutorial won’t cut it. I recommend you to check a good book on the subject.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/java-persistence-api/","title":"Java Persistence API"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/java-vector-is-obsolete/":{"body":"Today I was working with a unit test class for my Google Summer of Code project. Launching the test raised a concurrency exception due to me using ContiPerf to check the performance of some methods. It’s a situation that, given the piece of code tested, would not usually happen.\n\nBut seldom doesn’t equal never, so I proceeded to hunt the source of the error to fix it. The issue was a List that was being accessed via an iterator. The concrete implementation was an ArrayList, and I though I had cracked open the issue. I still remember from my SCJP that Vector is the class to use when you want a List that supports concurrency in Java.\nSo I replace it, compile the code, everything seems perfect and… wait a second. Netbeans is marking the line with an exclamation mark, let me check… Vector is deprecated?? What’s going on?\nYes, after a bit of Goggling it seems that Vector is deprecated. The main reason is that Vector does a synchronization per operation. That means you probably need a lock in the vector itself to avoid other threads to change it, as usually you are more interested in a lock for a series of operations, not in a lock for a specific operation.\nVector had not such good performance in its role, so it has been replaced. By who? Welcome the new kid in the block, Collection.synchronizedList. This is a method that takes a List as argument and will return a List with full synchronization whose data is baked by the list you provided.\nYou still need to use a lock if you use an iterator over the list, but for other operations the returned list will be thread safe.\n\nWarning: use the list returned by the method, not the one you\nprovided!\n\nAn example taken from the official JavaDoc:\n\nThat’s all. If you were using Vector (as I did until now):\n\nInstall Netbeans 6.9 so it will warn you the next time\nRefactor your code. You will benefit from safer and more efficient code.\n\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/java-vector-is-obsolete/","title":"Java Vector is Obsolete"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/learning-scala-in-coursera/":{"body":"Scala is growing, a lot. The (relatively) recent investment of $14M in the company ensures that the language will be taken care of and any remaining issues (like some necessary improvements for the IDE) tackled. Scala 2.10 is around the corner and with it all the performance and APi improvements. And Play is healthier than ever. Good times to be a Scala fan.\n\nAnother big step to make Scala more popular has been the Functional Programming in Scala course from Coursera. For people like myself who  learned the language via some book and StackOverflow questions, it’s been a very welcomed training to ensure Scala foundations were good enough and to polish the functional approach to coding.\nMaybe the approach is very academic, and in fact some problems are solved in convoluted ways just to force the student to implement specific methods. But all in all the course is great. The videos from Martin are polished and the explanations well delivered. And the automatic evaluation method is a nice touch :)\nNot only that, the course itself has served as trigger for some other interesting things:\n\nA Scala meetup was organized in Dublin, where we were able to chat and learn some more advanced techniques when using Scala\nI found myself being able to solve problems from 99 Scala problems with less effort, which seems to point to an increase in my Scala skils (update: some code available at Github, will be completing it as time allows)\nI could convince 3 other guys from my current job to join the course. It’s very good to share and compare notes on the exercises (no copying, I swear!), makes it much easier to understand new concepts.\n\nIt’s been long since I felt so comfortable and happy when coding in a given platform or language. Not many people will read this, but if you do: try it! It’s worth the effort. With such an active community and so many companies adopting Play and Scala, it’s silly not to.\nIn addition to all this, through the Scala course I discovered how great Coursera is as a learning platform. The downside for people addicted to learning like myself is that it could become time consuming in the near future (I joined around 20 courses for the next year) but the fact that you can resign at any time and that you may decide to not deliver the homework but still keep access the theory is of great value. It will be interesting to see if they can solve the issues around peer-grading, as they lower the value of some courses a bit. But the number of relevant subjects is incredible.\nSo, between Scala and Coursera (and some other projects) I’m keeping myself busy. But lots of fun ahead :)\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/learning-scala-in-coursera/","title":"Learning Scala in Coursera"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/learning-shapeless/":{"body":"Shapeless is a type class and dependent type based generic programming library for Scala. It had its origins in several talks by Miles Sabin, and he has been the main contributor to the project.\n\nWithin the community, Shapeless is considered both as a stepping stone towards very advanced Scala constructs and a hard to learn (and to master) library. Unfortunately, Shapeless documentation is a bit sparse so users must find external resources to learn parts of the library.\nMy aim with this blog post is to provide a list of useful resources that may help you understand Shapeless and how your project can benefit from using it.\n\nWhy Shapeless\nFirst of all you may want to know what are the benefits of using Shapeless. Is it only relevant for library authors, or is it a library you want to use on your production codebase?\nThese slides from Nigel Warren show some realistic use cases for Shapeless. A short read that can give you an idea on what you could achieve with it.\nThis video from Valentin Kasas at Scalar 2016 shows a practical use case of Shapeless and HList, with example code.\nThe above links are introductions to the library and, as such, limited in scope. But you can already see a common theme, via the use of HList constructs: to provide a single implementation that works with all your types, instead of one implementation for every single type.\nThis approach has obvious advantages: less code means less bugs and less surface to be tested, while the fact it works for any case class makes the code more robust against new types introduced in the future.\nI won’t deny the type signatures are a bit off-putting, but that is a small price to pay for the flexibility you can obtain.\n\nA Business Case\nEven after reading the links above you may still be a Shapeless skeptic, with the belief that is a tool with little benefit ‘in the real world’ (whatever that means to you). Confession time: I also was one, and it was a real-world issue at work what changed my mind.\nThe scenario is simple: we had a set of case classes representing different value types, and we needed to render them as Html, with reasonable expectations of adding many more types in the near future. So we wanted a simple way to convert exiting types plus any other type we would create later on.\nIf you have read some tutorials on Shapeless you may recognise this case as a common example to introduce some of the functionalities of the library, and this is so for a good reason: Shapeless excels at this task.\nI am not allowed to publish all the code, but you can see a relevant snippet below:\n\nI won’t explain the code itself, that’s not the aim of this post and in any case it’s not complete. What matters is that this snippet is the core of a fragment of code that thanks to methods hlistEncoder, coproductEncoder, and related definitions will convert any case class in the codebase to HTML. This includes any future case class we create later on, no changes required.\nAs a developer, it hardly gets better than this :)\n\nEffortless Shapeless\nYou may not be convinced of the benefits of Shapeless (ok, keep reading then) or maybe you feel learning Shapeless requires an amount of effort and time you cannot spare. I have good news for you: you don’t need to learn Shapeless to benefit from it.\nIf you browse the Scala index and search for shapeless you’ll see a lot of results. Besides Shapeless itself you will find entries like:\n\nArgonaut Shapeless which provides automatic derivation of codecs for your case classes\nShapeless Contrib which enables integration of Shapeless with libraries like Scalaz, which benefit from automatic derivation\n\nAnd many more. These libraries make your coding experience easier by leveraging shapeless. But you are not exposed to Shapeless itself, that’s hidden from you. For example, Argonaut Shapeless provides json codecs for your case classes automatically. So, as per the library documentation, this just works:\n\nAs you can see, no encoder nor decoder have been defined in the code, that being a tedious and repetitive task. Any new case class or ADT you add to your codebase benefits from this behaviour, automatically.\nBy using these libraries you will understand what Shapeless offers you much better, and they may be your ‘gateway library’ to learning Shapeless.\n\nLearning Shapeless\nYou have been convinced and want to learn Shapeless. Now what?\nA while ago that would mean scouring lots of links and blog posts online, to find information about the most recent release of the library. Nowadays there is a much straightforward solution, thanks to Dave Gurnell and Underscore: read the Shapeless book.\nYes, there is a free ebook that explains how to use Shapeless, and it is a great book. Thanks Dave!\nNot only that, but 47 Degrees have released Scala Exercises, a free website where you can practice some of the Shapeless concepts.\nAnd for the cases not covered by Scala Exercises, Scala Fiddle allows you to select Shapeless as an available library (see Libraries section on the left-hand panel), so that you can test your Shapeless snippets online. Who needs an IDE?\nThis means you can easily read documentation on Shapeless and solve some exercises to test your newly acquired knowledge. What’s your excuse? Go and start learning!\n\nAdditional Guides\nThe existence of the Shapeless book and Scala Exercises makes learning Shapeless much easier, but I would be remiss if I dismissed other guides you can find online.\nI find it very useful, when trying to learn a new and complex subject, to read many posts about the same idea. The repetition of the concepts breeds familiarity (hopefully without contempt!) with the concepts, and an array of examples allows for better understanding of the core ideas plus some of their nuances.\nTo this aim I recommend you to read the following posts, either before starting the book or as complementary documentation to flesh out the trickier concepts:\n\nJulien wrote an introduction to Shapeless which describes (at a very high level) the main components of the library\nEdoardo Vacchi wrote a good primer on Shapeless that delves into a bit more detail than Julien’s article.\nAnatolii Kmetiuk wrote a couple of posts that describe both HList and Poly in much more detail.\nVladimir Pavkin shows how to implement a typesafe request builder using Shapeless, a more practical example.\nAnd, lastly, if you want to see Travis Brown doing some magic with Shapeless to solve a Project Euler problem please read this stack overflow answer\n\nAs mentioned, these links are complementary to the book but worth reading.\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful.

It only gives basic information, for more details about life cycle and other functionalities check the EJB 3.0 reference or some book like EJB3 in Action.\n\nMessage-Driven Beans are an abstraction over Java Messaging Service (JMS). They are used to send and receive messages in your application without having to know all the details about JMS. That said a good understanding of JMS is important for the correct use of MDB. The advantages of MDB over standard JMS coding are the services provided by the container (like pooling) and the reduction on code size due to automation of tasks.\nBy message (in the context of a JEE application) we mean an asynchronous and loosely coupled communication between system components. Using Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) messages sent are stored until a consumer is available to read them. We consider two types of communication:\n\nPoint-to-point: the message is stored in a queue and received by one of the N possible consumers of the message\nPublish-Subscribe: message is received by N subscribers that belong to a specific group of receivers\n\nMDB are POJOs like other EJB and require a public constructor without arguments. You can’t throw any RuntimeException or RemoteException as that would cause the MDB to be terminated. They also have the following requirements:\n\n\nImplement MessageListener interface\n\n\nuse @MessageDriven annotation to configure the queue they are listening and some JMS properties (using @ActivationConfigProperty). Values include:\n\n\nacknowledgeMode: (on Queues) to notify the consumption of the message\n\n\nsubscriptionDurability: (on Topics) guaranties delivery of message to offline subscribers\n\n\nmessageSelector: filters messages consumed using a property of the message included in the message header\n\n\n\n\nit has two lifecycle callbacks (@PreDestroy and @PostConstruct) equivalent to the Session Bean ones.\n\n\ncan send messages but you need to follow the JMS API for that, using a Connection Factory, etc.\n\n\nby default the “onMessage” method creates a transaction that rolls-back if there’s any error while processing the message, leaving the message in the queue for another consumer.\n\n\nExample of MDB listening to a Queue (point-to-point communication) named SampleServerQueue:\n\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/message-driven-beans/","title":"Message-Driven Beans"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/mining-massive-datasets/":{"body":"As part of my efforts to understand more of the data science world, I’ve joined another Coursera class: Mining Massive Datasets.

Do you like Monkey Island? Are you into Insult Sword Fighting? Then, come along, this may interest you ;)\n\nBackstory\nI’ve been wanting to try AWS Lambda for a while. To be honest I’ve not yet done so due to laziness: my experience with AWS is that it needs more configuration and tweaking than I care for. Give me a Heroku any day (pros and cons, lengthy discussion for another day).\nBut going through my ‘list of stuff you should read’ I recently saw an Underscore blog-post by Richard Dallaway. AWS again, maybe it’s time to do something that uses it!\nThat got me started: sure there must be alternatives, something akin to “Heroku for Lambdas”? Yes, I’m aware AWS Lambdas are simple to use, but well, procrastination… So I started looking for options and I landed on a Quora question which pointed me to WebTask.io.\n\nUsing WebTask\nWebTask.io sounds exactly like what I was looking for. And, oh boy, it is simple to use!\nI followed their instructions to install their cli, which gives you a very intuitive command wt with options you’d expect (create, rm, ls). In just a few minutes I had my own endpoint running. Neat.\nNow I needed something to test this a bit more. Enter Monkey Island. If you have played those games you most likely remember their Insult Sword Fighting scenes. Even if you didn’t play it you may know what they are, due to popularity in certain circles.\nImplementing a service that given a specific insult returns the correct answer seemed like a very straightforward task that would let me test the service and find any obvious hurdles. So that’s what I built; you can get the code in my github repo.\nThe service has a very basic behaviour:\n\nIf you just call the endpoint (GET request), returns a random pair of insult-answer (in Json)\nIf you call the endpoint with an insult parameter it will return the correct response for that insult\nIf you call the endpoint with an invalid/unknown insult the response will notify you so\n\nThe interaction is all via GET requests, and it returns Json (no 404 codes for invalid insults). As I said, a very basic implementation to test how hard is to use that service (note: not hard at all). Webkit  provides the tools to implement all this properly, it’s just I didn’t use them ;)\n\nTesting the service\nI published a Webtask endpoint at:\n\nBe aware it is under a free plan, so it may be rate limited and disappear in 30 days. If you want to try it yourself, remember the sample code is available in my github repo.\nLet’s see how it works. If we run the request without any additional parameter, we should obtain a random pair of insult-response.\n\nreturns:\n\nWe can provide a parameter with our insult to receive the right response:\n\nwhich, as expected, returns:\n\nIf we provide an insult that is not recognised, like:\n\nthe lambda complains:\n\nWorking as expected!\n\nFuture Work\nTo be honest, I just wanted to dabble with this so I didn’t put much more effort into it. An obvious improvement is to allow the user to fight against the machine, although this would require preserving some state in the server-side.\nFortunately WebTask provides limited support for storage, which could be used to manage score for a given user, storing all the information in a map. But there’ll be concurrency issues with very low loads, so it may not be such a good idea after all. Something stateless like left-pad.io fits the lambda model better ;)\nAs an aside, WebTask mentions in their documentation how their service can be used to enhance the security of your application by hiding api keys and other sensitive resources inside lambdas. It’s an interesting concept worth a bit of research, as it may be a good pattern to adapt in your standard deployment.\nIn any case, that’s all for now.

As I said, there are plenty of summaries out there and I think by not reading the book but the excerpts, you will be missing a lot. So, why this post then? Well, the book contains many relevant ideas that just fit, they seem completely obvious and you wonder why you didn’t think about them before. It explains a way of working quite different from the one I’m used to, and given that my new company uses this process I have plenty of work ahead of me to adapt. But, mostly, because one concept in the book made me think about my personal workflow.\nLet’s talk about that concept: waste.\nThe book spends a decent amount of time talking about waste in a company, but what about waste in our personal life? This is not a brilliant personal breakthrough, even the opposite: it is an obvious thought. It’s a popular subject online, plenty of places talk about it and there are plenty of applications out there to try to help you managing your time.\nBut even when you know about it and expect it, waste has a tendency to creep into your life and become a bad habit without you noticing it. And the problem is not the waste that we can expect and, somehow, limit: hours lost to Twitter, Youtube, Games or similar. No. As an example, the book mentions how a company can stop a production lane because it is more beneficial to solve an issue then than to keep working with it going on. Not a direct translation to personal habits, but what about work for work’s sake? Or about bad habits that may look useful but, if you look at them in detail, they are not?\nTry a simple exercise: take an excel spreadsheet and draw a table of 7 x 24 cells. Label the 7 rows as the days of the week and number the columns to map the hours in a day. Now, write in each cell  what you did during that hour the last week. Once you are done, count how many blank cells you have. That’s your free time. Colour it, if you want, to make it more visible. Not so much, isn’t it? Scared? Where did your time go?\nRecently Amy Hoy has sent to their email subscribers some content on this subject. A collection of ideas to reduce waste on your personal life and free some time for your personal objectives. You will need to join her mailing list to see the content as I can’t link it here. And she is not the only one: methodologies like GTD exist to streamline your tasks, to optimize your output and be more efficient. As if.\nPersonally, I’ve noticed a repeating pattern in my tasks: I build waste periodically, and I end up doing massive clean ups from time to time in which I go through my TO-DO list and start removing things. The worst part is the way the list grows. A piece of news that I can’t check at work, stored for later. A long technical talk that I intend to watch that evening but, for some reason, I end up not watching that day. Some relevant module or technology that may require a couple of hours of my time to test it. Slowly, things add up. And one day you have plenty of important tasks and many small ones that you couldn’t tackle in the past. And, after the clean up, the cycle starts again.\nBecause, how easy is to identify waste before it becomes so? You have personal projects, career aspirations, a social life, a wife… It may seem obvious to keep a link to a video to check it later. Of course I should do activity x, is good for this part of my life. And so on. We have many facets (or we should if we want to fully enjoy life) and what is relevant to one facet may be waste to another. Prioritizing is not easy (besides the obvious ones), the hours are limited and things pile up. You don’t want to miss things. But it’s unavoidable, you’ll miss things and your acceptance of this fact is key. But it’s not easy, nor convenient.\nHow to solve this? Processes can be cumbersome and produce more waste than they save. I personally use Trello and Remember The Milk to manage my time, and they kind of work, but they are not perfect. Is this a business opportunity? Maybe. There are simple ways to do this? Maybe. But it is not simple, for sure.\nSo, yes, interesting book and it helped me to pay more attention to my personal organization. Hopefully I’ll improve in this area, I’ll keep you posted.\nObviously, feel free to send me your ideas on this issue. I’ll be glad to chat :)\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/on-learn-startup-and-personal-waste/","title":"On Learn Startup and Personal Waste"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/playing-with-rust/":{"body":"Rust is not, at this stage, a new language. But I have to confess that I had not checked it out until now. I built a small tool to test it out. In this post I’ll briefly talk about how it felt working with Rust from the point of view of a Scala developer.\n\nDuring the last Scala Exchange I heard a lot of people talking about Rust. As a consequence, learning more about the language became a higher priority, as it is always good to listen to people with more experience :). It was also an excuse to use Visual Studio Code a bit more, to familiarise with its bindings so I can get the most out of Metals.\nThe best way to learn a new language is to build something with it, as that is the scenario when you hit all the common problems. What I wanted to avoid is to fight not only Rust but also some web framework or library on top of it. Time ago I built a tool to delete old tweets from my account, using Scala: twitter privacy. It works well, but the nature of the program (running in a cron job once a day) makes it much slower than it should be, due to cold-start time of the JVM.\nRust is known as a fast language, and a replacement of this tool using Rust seemed like a good fit for learning the language without having too many libraries involved. You can find the source code of the outcome  in github, and it has been published to cargo.io.\nIf you want to use it for your own social media maintenance, instructions on how to run it are in the Readme file in Github.\n\nRust as a language\nAs a Scala developer, I found Rust a very interesting language. For example, I’ve heard very often criticism towards the duality OO-FP of Scala,\npointing it was a bad decision. Rust clearly states in their book that they support both, having a chapter dedicated\nto each one, and on how to work in that particular way with the language.\nRust has a very active community and very good documentation for their tooling and libraries. For example, check the documentation for Cargo, it’s build tool. Or for one of the libraries I used, Egg_Mode.\nThe community is actively trying to exploit the advantages of Rust (speed, memory management). There’s a lot of work to build libraries using Rust in domains like game development, machine learning, or web development.\nA key area for Rust growth may be WebAssembly, a binary format enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. Rust already compiles to it and has good tolling and  documentation. This could enable a real ‘build once and deploy anywhere’ development mode, without the issues caused by nuances of different platforms.\nIn general working with it felt familiar and there weren’t many unexpected surprises. The following comments come from someone which has been working extensively in the JVM world, with some non-professional experience in non-JVM languages.\n\nThe Good\nI liked the language and I felt comfortable with it, but there are some things worth of mention:\n\n\nSpeed. It’s been so many years using Scala that I forgot how fast can a CPU. Both compilation and execution are fast, and help with keeping the development flow. No time for a small break on Twitter, or similar.\n\n\nTypeclasses (using Traits). I got too used to Typeclasses and it would be hard to move to a language without them. The restriction on implementing instances of a Typeclass which doesn’t belong to your package have been a bit of a nuisance at some stages, but I understand the motivation behind that call, and it’s not a deal breaker.\n\n\nCargo. It’s what sbt should be. The only tool you need as a developer to compile, test, benchmark, or publish to a central repository. Which, by the way, is a trivial to do (compared to the nightmare of publishing to Sonatype).\n\n\nLocal documentation. The fact that you can, with a single cargo command, open the documentation of your dependencies for the specific version you are using is a life-saver. In this particular project the library that interacts with Twitter has changed a lot between the last published version and the current version under development, thus going to the online documentation could be very confusing.\n\n\n\nThe Less Good\nNothing is perfect, less so when you are experimenting with a new language. Some aspects that made the learning-curve harder:\n\n\nLifetimes. It’s one of the main features of Rust, it comes with major benefits, but it was a pain to manage. I had to refactor a lot of code because at the top level a closure would give me a lifetime error that I couldn’t fix. I guess with experience you get better at it, and it forces you to make smaller methods to avoid odd dependencies, but… it can be a pain. Garbage collection is a blessing, sometimes.\n\n\nSemicolons. Used to Scala, having to add semicolons at the end of most of the lines wasn’t a great experience. The worst is exactly that most of the lines part, as there are lines in which you don’t want semicolons as they change the meaning of the expression. Not hard to grasp, but feels like a step backwards.\n\n\nSnake Case. Ok, it’s something minor, but after so many years in the JVM world, moving to Snake case wasn’t easy, habits die hard. And clippy was complaining non-stop about it.\n\n\nBigger files. In Rust it is idiomatic to add your unit tests at the end of the file. The issue is that you end up having very long files, which are harder to navigate. It may be due to being used to the JVM way, but having a separate test folder with specific code in there feels, somehow, cleaner.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nI feel that Rust is great for low level work, but currently it can’t replace a stack like http4s and cats due to a lack of libraries supporting it. There are a set of community pages (the AreWe pages, as seen before) that explain the progress in some areas. Looking at, for example, Are We Async one can see that today (February 2019) several RFC are still in progress and some unresolved questions remain open.\nI hope they catch up soon, as the speed on both compilation and execution plus the FP support may make it a worthy alternative to Scala. But, right now, I think I’ll stick to my trusted tools for backend development, and dable with Rust only for specific needs.\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter/Email is more than welcome.

I’ve wanted to play with it for a long time, but it was one of these things you keep delaying as I wasn’t sure what to use it for. After moving to London, and given that my NAS died, I found myself in need of a replacement, one that allowed me to install Crashplan on it if possible (for cloud backup).\n\nA commercial NAS unit was a no go even if they had support for Crashplan: they are quite expensive and my experience with Lacie units has not been the best. Having a desktop on 24/7 to manage backups would allow me to install Crashplan on it, but it seemed a waste of cpu and electricity. And here is when Raspberry Pi came to save the day: it can be used as a low power PC, but it has enough RAM and CPU to work as NAS and provide some other services. Low power consumption (some estimates are £5-10 per year) and my files are safe. Success!\nAs I write this I have my Raspberry Pi connected to 1 Tb storage, using Samba to allow access to the files across the network and backing up all my data via Crashplan. It can even serve videos to my TV via DLNA. It is not complex to do, but it required browsing a few articles online and putting together some information. In this post I summarise the steps on how to achieve this. I apologise in advance as the post has no images, which makes it a bit dry, but hopefully it is easy to follow.\n\nRequirements\nTo follow these steps you need:\n\nRaspberry Pi B with 8 Gb SD card. Take the B model as it has 512Mb of RAM (and you WILL need them). Also buy the SD card they sell, as it has the default operating system (Raspbian) preloaded. It saves time and problems.\nSeagate Backup Plus (1 Tb). This hard drive doesn’t require an external power cable, it only uses 1 USB cable to connect it to the Raspberry unit, which makes it convenient.\nPower supply for Raspberry Pi. They sell one in their shop, but you can also use any mini USB power supply you have that follows their specifications.\nHDMI cable. To connect Raspberry Pi to a monitor during the initial setup.\nUSB keyboard. For the first configuration steps.\nNetwork cable. You will have one USB port taken by the HD, so it’s better to keep the other free for a keyboard and connect the Raspberry to the network by cable.\n\nOnce you have all the pieces, you can start. I have added references to the sources where I found how to set up the Raspberry in each section, but if you get stuck check Stack Exchange as they have a forum dedicated to Raspberry with a lot of useful information.\n\nSetup of Raspberry Pi\nRaspberry has a helpful guide to set up the unit. If you bought the SD card with NOOBS preinstalled then you can skip the few first steps and go straight to the part talking about the first boot.\nBasically, select Raspbian (the recommended OS for Raspberry, Debian based) and wait for it to be installed. It will take a while. Then you will be prompted to restart the unit. After rebooting Raspbian will automatically load a configuration menu, in which we will tweak some options:\n\nOption 1, expand filesystem. It is not needed in NOOBS but run it just in case\nOption 2, set a new password for the user pi. Given that we will log via ssh, you need this\nOption 8, in advanced options make sure that ssh is enabled. I also overclocked the unit (middle option) as it will be running quite a few services.\n\nOnce you are done, exit and reboot the unit. Then log into it and install avahi:\n\nThis will allow us to ssh to the Raspberry via the hostname raspberrypi.local, removing the need to keep track of its ip. Once installed, reboot again the unit and try to log into it via ssh:\n\nThis is the recommended way to connect to the Raspberry Pi. You can remove the HDMI cable and the keyboard from the unit and use ssh from now on to operate on it.\nHere is another guide that can help you by covering areas that may not be clear.\n\nRaspberry as NAS\nAfter setting our Raspberry Pi, we will turn it into a NAS system using Samba, so we can copy files across the network. This requires the external HD to be connected to the unit. There are a couple of step by step guides available which can help you through the process. The guides also mention how to use a second hard drive for local data redundancy. I only use one HD by now, but it can be a recommended step to ensure you don’t lose data.\nAs per the guides, the HD is left in NTFS. It is slower than EXT4, but allows us to connect it to a Windows machine directly in case of need. To be able to use that filesystem we need some extra packages, installed via:\n\n\nMounting the HD\nThe external hard drive (if you only use one) will be recognised as /dev/sda1 by Raspbian. We need to mount it permanently in our filesystem. I chose to mount it in the folder /media/hd1, by doing the following:\n\nThis creates the folder, and mounts the external HD into it. We now need to tell the system to mount the unit every time it boots. Edit fstab:\n\nand add the following line at the bottom:\n\nSave and you can restart the Raspberry Pi to check that the disk is mounted at /media/hd1.\n\nSamba\nWe use a specific folder in the HD for our Samba share, so we can isolate the shared folder from other files we may want to store in the disk.\n\nInstall Samba, do a backup of the default configuration and edit it by running:\n\nIn the config file, uncomment the line:\n\nand add at the bottom of the file:\n\nI also took a page of this guide on optimising Samba and replaced the socket options in the file by:\n\nwith the aim of improving performance.\nThe next step is creating a user that can access the share when connecting via the network. I created a user called nas, typing the password I chose when prompted:\n\nRestart Samba:\n\nand you should be able to access the share in your network by using the user nas and its credentials.\n\nCrashplan\nCrashplan is my tool of choice for remote backups, sending the data in our NAS to the cloud. We will run it as a headless client, which means that we run the service in Raspberry but the client, which we use to configure the backup options, runs in another computer and connects via the network.\nThe service is a Java application, which means that we have to install the jvm into Raspberry Pi. Given that the Oracle implementation is much better than the OpenJDK one, the first step is to purge OpenJDK and install Oracle’s Java, ensuring it is the default choice in the system:\n\nAt this point, we can follow the steps in this guide to install Crashplan in our Raspberry.  The guide also install Java 8, we skip that and go straight to point 8. I summarise the steps in here as a quick reference.\nFirst Download Crashplan for Linux, copy it to the Raspberry (via scp) and extract it there. Then run the installer:\n\nAccept the license and select the default locations for the installation. Then you need to patch libjtux and md5 library by downloading the linked files and copying them to /usr/local/crashplan/.\nYou also need to install libjna for Java:\n\nOnce done, edit /usr/local/crashplan/bin/CrashPlanEngine and find the line that begins with FULL_CP=, around the start case, and edit it so it looks like:\n\nThe last step is to run the Crashplan engine at boot time by editing /etc/rc.local and adding on the line above exit 0:\n\nRestart the unit and if everything worked when you run:\n\nyou should see the service is running.\nThere is a comment in the above guide that shows how to modify the swap to point to another file. There are two good reasons for this. First of all, the default swap in Raspberry is not much, and Raspbian may kill processes heavy in RAM when running low on memory, increasing the swap will avoid it killing Crashplan on a whim. Secondly, Java may do heavy use of the swap and thus shorten the life of the SD card by doing many writes to it, which we can fix by moving the swap to our external disk. I created a swap file in the external hd by following the instructions:\n\nThen we apply this change on each boot by editing /etc/fstab and adding to the bottom (to ensure the disk that contains the swap is mounted first):\n\nRestart the Raspberry and execute free. You should see a swap of 1Gb.\nI won’t enter into detail on how to connect a headless client as the official guide explains it perfectly. Just remember that you will need to run the tunnel every time you connect via the client, and the tunnels timeout from time to time.\nNow configure Crashplan to backup the files in /media/hd1/share to their cloud and you are done.\nThere is an optional last step you can follow. The settings above should ensure that Crashplan is not killed by Raspbian, but this may happen. To fix this without us having to ssh into the box every day, I’ve added a cronjob that restarts the Raspberry every day at 2 am. If you are not a crontab expert you can see how to do this in this stack exchange question, just replace the 0,8 by a 2. In my case 2am is not a time when I will be using the NAS, so a restart should not be an issue and it will ensure that any services that were killed are restarted accordingly.\n\nTorrents\nWe have a NAS backed up in the cloud. Given that it will be running 24/7, we can try to squeeze it a bit more by adding a torrent client to the box. That way you can download you latest Linux distro without having to keep your desktop on all night, Raspberry rakes care about it. There is a guide on how to install deluge as a headless server, which we can then access via a remote client or a web interface.\nTo start, we install deluged and we run it so it creates the default config files:\n\nWait for a couple of minutes so all the files are created, and then kill the process:\n\nNow we backup the authentication file and edit it to add a new user:\n\nThere you can add a user in the format user:password:10. The user and password don’t need to match any existing user, they are the credentials you will use to remotely connect to the server via the client. Now we start the service again and we enter into the console:\n\nIn the console we run the following commands to allow for remote connections to the service:\n\nAnd to apply the new configuration we restart the service:\n\nThe last step is to run deluged at boot time by editing /etc/rc.local and adding on the line above exit 0:\n\nI won’t explain how to connect via the client as the guide linked above has a complete explanation, with images, and it is quite straightforward. I just recommend you to only download 1 torrent at once and to set the destination folder for all the torrents to a path inside the samba share, so you can access it from the network. Just make sure Crashplan doesn’t backup that folder. As we have plenty of memory in use in this Raspberry I’ve not installed the web interface as I thought it was of little benefit and we can use that RAM for other things.\n\nDLNA\nGiven the amount of storage in the NAS, we will probably keep plenty of photos and videos in it. We can install a DLNA compliant server in our Raspberry that will index all the media files in our share and make them available to any DLNA compatible device: smartphones, laptops or TVs. We do this by installing minidlna, an open source implementation of the protocol.\nThe process, taken from this guide, is extremely simple. Be aware that the guide does many other things we already took care of, just skip them and scroll down to the part that says install minidlna. In your Raspberry run:\n\nWith this minidlna is installed and ready to run when rebooting the unit. Modify the configuration by editing /etc/minidlna.conf (as root). In the config, look for the following sections and update accordingly:\n\nThe media folders are an example, set them accordingly as per your share folder structure. The other two entries store minidlna metadata and logs in the external hd so we have enough room for them.\nRestart the service via:\n\nAnd wait for the service to index all the files. It is quite fast, depending on how many media files you own, but until a file is indexed you won’t be able to access it.\n\nConclusion\nYou are done, you have a NAS with full cloud backup, torrenting capabilities and that can act as a media centre and show videos or photos in your TV. Congratulations! Enjoy it as much as I do enjoy mine :)\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/raspberry-pi-as-nas-with-samba/","title":"Raspberry Pi as NAS with Samba"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/reactconf-and-orm-future/":{"body":"I’ve been pretty busy lately at Gumtree, but I still got time to publish some posts in our Dev Team blog.\n\nThe first one, which has got quite a lot of traction, is The end of ORM where I talk about how Akka persistence may be the solution for the headaches ORM cause.\nThe second, split in two parts, is a summary of the talks in React.conf 2014.

There is a lot of truth in this but if we think about it a bit more it feels that, nowadays, the way this is happening is via machine learning and analytics. These are the tools that can move personalization to the next level and, with it, changing the way services interact with customers.\n\nAll that is just to justify why I’ve started the first lesson of Real-Time Analytics with Apache Storm, a free Udacity course. Recently I’ve tried to narrow down things I do to a few relevant ones, instead of being too spread out into many unrelated tasks. And, as I wrote at the start of the post, I truly believe real-time analytics is the next big software revolution (well, arguably is already ongoing, not that I’m a visionary of any kind) so, as a developer, any effort on it is worth the time.\nSo, how was it? The course has 4 lessons and today I’ve finished the first one. This is an introductory lesson in which you set up your environment and you learn some of the pitfalls of real-time analytics along what’s the role of Storm in this field.\nCode wise you have some very simple problems in which you modify existing topologies, but I feel these basic exercises help you getting familiar with Storm’s architecture.

As of 17th of August of 2009, Launchpad is not yet ready for production. The only way to install it is using an script, only available for Ubuntu 9.04, which doesn’t work too well on a server. I’ll keep an eye on it as I like the way Canonical does things (and applications), but in the meantime I decided to use Redmine as I found Trac lacking on some areas.\n\nRedmine\nRedmine is an open source, web-based project management and bug-tracking tool, written in Ruby on Rails and heavily influenced by Trac. It improves on several areas, like providing multiple project support, integrating with several source control systems (from popular SVN to less popular Bazaar or Darcs) and allowing extension of its functionalities through plugins. This guide describes how to install Redmine in an Ubuntu 9.04 server using Mongrel as web server, Nginx as proxy and MySQL as database. To achieve this we have to follow 3 steps:\n\ninstall ruby and rails and MySQL\ninstall Redmine\ninstall Mongrel and Nginx\n\nThis guide can be adapted to older versions of Ubuntu and most Linux distributions, just replacing the tools/packages by the specific ones available in that distribution. The guide is a quick overview of the main steps, for  more information on configuration options check the documentation of the corresponding tool.\n\nInstall Ruby and Rails and MySQL\nTo install the components first ensure the system is up to date:\n\nThen run the following command:\n\nNow that we have Ruby installed, we use Gems to install Rails:\n\nThe flags –no-rdoc and –no-ri are included to reduce the RAM footprint of the component, feel free to remove them if your machine has more than enough RAM. To finish this part, open the MySQL client and create the Redmine database:\n\n\nInstall Redmine\nGet the code from the download page. Although the stable release is recommended, if you are going to use Bazaar the svn contains some fixes you want to use, so do an export from the trunk and use that. (Note: if you use the trunk, you’ll have to install a newer Rails using Gems due to version requirements). Select a folder in your server (from now on, APP) and copy the downloaded code there. Move to the APP folder and run:\n\nEdit the new yml files and change the configuration as required (MySQL details, mail server, etc).  Now run these commands to create the database and populate it:\n\nWe also need ImageMagick  (although is optional):\n\n\nInstall Mongrel and Nginx\nTo run Redmine we will use a standard setup for Rails applications, consistent on Mongrel as web server and Nginx as proxy that interacts with the network. We will run Mongrel as Mongrel Cluster, to improve the performance as Mongrel is single threaded and we will need multiple instances to server multiple clients. First we need to install Mongrel and Mongrel Cluster:\n\nNow move to APP folder and run:\n\nThe flag -p indicates the initial port to use by Mongrel. Flag -N tells how many instances you want running in the cluster. Flag -a shows the bind address of the cluster. Once created, we need to set it up so it starts automatically with the server:\n\nNow you can control the cluster with the commands:\n\nNow install nginx (if you don’t have it):\n\nWe need to create a virtual host for Nginx, that will receive the requests and forward them to Redmine. Assuming your public domain will be “domain.com”:\n\nAnd copy inside:\n\nBe careful to change the port numbers and domain name to the ones you’ll use on your server. Now enable the site:\n\nand once you restart Nginx your Redmine installation is ready to go. Configure Bazaar First we need to edit the file config/environment.rb to add new environment variables related to Python, to avoid problems while accessing Bazaar:\n\nWhen you create a project you just need to point Redmine to your Bazaar main folder, this will allow you to browse the repository. Be aware it still has some limitations when displaying contents, but it works quite well. To work with Bazaar, let’s set up a repository on  our server. This will be a dumb repository, it means is nothing more than a  folder that can be accessed via sftp that stores the data of the repository. First of all, in Ubuntu 9.04 (our server) let’s install the needed tools (sftp) and enable them as accepted shell:\n\nThen create a user to connect via sftp to the server:\n\nAnd that’s it, we have a folder (/home/bzr/) ready to receive our Bazaar projects. Is a good practice to give write rights to that folder to members of group “bzr”, and to add a password to the ‘bzr’ user. On your client machine, install Bazaar (using apt-get or similar). Then download the Uploader plugin which eases the task to commit changes to “dumb servers”:\n\nor if you use Ubuntu/Debian with:\n\nThen create the base repository. There are two ways of doing this, you can create a shared repository which stores every child branch revision, or you can create standalone repositories, which are good if you don’t want to share revision information with other branches. Here we create a shared repository:\n\nNow, to interact with the server we created before, first run:\n\nThis pushes the project to the server and creates the folder ‘test’ if needed. After that, all the interaction with the server can be (usually) reduced to:\n\nOk, is not the nicest way to do that, but remember this is a distributed repository, you won’t update or push changes too often, usually only when you are done with a piece of work.  There’s an alternative method, using what is called a “smart server”, which is faster than the previous way (but not always possible to use for several reasons). In this case we will use an ssh connection to communicate with the repository, but this requires that our user belongs to the group “bzr” to be able to write in that folder. The command for the first commit is:\n\nIn a similar way we interact with the server using:\n\n\nInstall Redmine Themes\nYou can install some new themes for Redmine, available here. Although is mainly a cosmetic change, some themes provide enhancements like colouring tickets according to priority and they are really easy to manage. For example, to install the Basecamp theme:\n\nDownload application.css\nCreate required directories: mkdir -p redmine/public/themes/basecamp/stylesheets\nCopy downloaded file:  cp application.css redmine/public/themes/basecamp/stylesheets\n\nThat’s it .. now restart your instance running Redmine and select the new basecamp theme from /settings\n\nInstall Redmine Plugins\nRedmine provides several plugins that enhance the capabilities of the tool. Amongst them you can find some nice ones like:\n\nBots Filter: avoids bots from accessing certain areas of the application\nCharts: adds some project based charts\nException Handler: notifies admins when an exception occurs\nHudson: integrates Redmine and Hudson, allowing you to see Hudson reports\nStatus updates: allows users to say what are they doing, kind of Twitter per project.\nVote: allows users to vote on issues so you see which ones are important to them\n\nYou can find these and many more in this page . To install a plugin, follow the instructions on the “Installation” section of its page. Then restart Redmine and you are good to go.\n\nConnect Mylyn to Redmine\nIf you use Mylyn (and you should!) use these instructions to connect it to your Redmine repository.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/redmine-on-ubuntu-9-dot-04-with-nginx/","title":"Redmine on Ubuntu 9.04 with NGinx"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/refining-your-data/":{"body":"This is just a short entry to make you aware of a new post (again!) at Underscore’s blog.\nAs usual, many thanks to Underscore for all the suggestions and reviews, and for publishing it.

In Scala the combo of Metals and VS Code for development has become the norm for many people. How easy and convenient may it be to use them while on ssh with a remote server? Let’s discover it.\n\nWhy would someone do that\nFirst of all we should tackle an obvious question: why would a developer do that? The answer is that there are many valid scenarios for this approach:\n\nsomeone may work in a big corporation that gives lower-end Windows laptops, but has several servers available for developers to use\nsomeone may not have enough budget to replace their aging laptop, and it is looking at the cloud as a cheaper alternative\nan employer has Intellectual Property concerns and would like tight controls on where is the codebase cloned to\na developer uses mainly a desktop and they don’t want to buy a powerful laptop, but recently they need to travel more and still code\na developer is fed up with seeing iStats show 90+ C degrees on the cpu sensor of their laptop, sustained while sbt compiles the project\n\nOr, if none of them applies, just because we can. We’ll talk about cost-effectiveness of this approach towards the end of the post.\n\nSetting up your environment\nTo make this work you will need:\n\na local machine capable of running Visual Studio Code.\na remote server, preferably with Linux (we use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).\nto read and follow the steps in this post, adapting as needed if you use a different OS on your remote host.\n\nThe requirements for Visual Studio Code are quite low, remember that the heavy lifting (compiling) won’t be done in the local machine, so even old laptops should work fine.\nIdeally you have some internet exposed desktop or server that you can use as the remote host. If you don’t have any at hand, look at a VPS service like Linode or Hetzner. We’d recommend against AWS or GCP as they seem to be more expensive for worse performance. This post will use Linode, for no other reason that we used it in the past and we were happy with it. No affiliation with the brand.\nImportant note: if you are creating a new account in a VPS, expect to provide a valid credit card number to cover for the costs of any usage. There may also be a delay while they verify your account details; a new account via a UK-based Ltd company with Linode took 30m to be verified.\n\nCreating your remote developer instance\nFirst of all, provision an instance for the server if you need it. We use Linode Dedicated CPU instances as they are supposed to have better CPU performance. You can follow these steps to create one. We chose the following settings:\n\nOS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\nRegion: London\nPlan: Dedicated 8 Gb (4 cores, 8 Gb RAM)\nProvide root password and ssh key for your local machine\n\nProvisioning takes around one minute, and then you can ssh into the box with ssh root@&lt;ip&gt;.\nImportant note: on new accounts with Linode, you need to open a ticket with support to enable Dedicated 16 Gb and Dedicated 32 Gb Linode for your account. Otherwise you won’t be allowed to create those instances. Other VPS may have similar rules.\nOnce the machine is up, ssh into it. The next step is to install a valid JDK. You can use Adopt OpenJDK by running the following:\n\nThen edit your .profile and add an export for JAVA_HOME to it:\n\nWe also want to increase the number of file descriptors available to avoid issues with VS Code and large projects. To that end, edit /etc/sysctl.conf\nand add to the bottom of the file fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 and run sysctl -p to reapply the changes.\nWe also want sbt and npm (for scala.js), which we can install as follows:\n\nTo be able to work with Github, you will need to add the ssh public key of this instance to your profile. To generate a key, run:\n\nCopy the output of the last command and add it to your SSH key list in Github.\nAs the last step, clone the repository of cats so that we can run some tests on it later:\n\nWith these, your remote server should be ready to run scala code. As the next step, we need to connect a VS Code instance to it.\n\nConnecting Visual Studio Code\nOpen your VS Code and install the extension Remote - SSH.\nThen follow the official documentation to connect to the remote server:\n\nopen the Remote Explorer menu and add your server\nonce configured, you can connect to the server. This will open a new VS Code window. The bottom panel will show (on the left side) that you are connected to a remote server\nextensions are (usually) installed on the server, which means you will need to reinstall Metals. Open the Extensions panel, in there you will see that extensions are split between local and ssh. Scroll the local list and press the green install in ssh button for all those extensions you want to enable on your remote machine.\nif you haven’t done so, search for Metals and install it. Then reload the window.\nEdit VS Code settings for Metals, on the ssh section for your remote machine set the proper path for Java Home in Metals (see previous section of this post for the path). This will require another reload of VS Code.\n\nIf you installed the Live Share extension, you may be prompted to install additional components, which requires yet another window refresh.\n\nLoading your project\nOnce the VS Code window has reloaded and reconnected to the server, you can just go to File &gt; Open and select the cats project you cloned when setting up the server.\nMetals will let you know that this is an sbt project and it will request to load it.\nThat’s it. Once Metals completes the set up, you are ready to go and code as you are used to.\nImportant: Note that any terminal you open while in the ssh window will open directly in the remote server.\n\nBacking up your remote server\nAt this point you want to create an image of your server. Note that Linode (and most other platforms) will still charge you for the box if you stop it, as it is still provisioned for you.\nTo reduce costs what you want is to have an image with the latest changes to your server, which you can do following these steps. Building the image took less than 2 minutes for our server. Once you have the image, you can delete your instance and create a new one when needed, using that image as a starting point. The image will keep the same ssh public key, which means you can interact with Github using your account without any additional steps.\nNote that in Linode you have some restrictions on images but even so this should be enough for your purposes. Alternatively, you could use Stack Scripts or some other automated system to create images on demand.\n\nPerformance\nNow that we have everything set up, we need to verify how fast is this setup. How does it compare to running everything locally? To test this we downloaded cats and we run ;clean;test in sbt a few times. The following is a completely non-scientific table of the measurements:\nMachineAvg\nMacbook 16“ late 2019 (8 cores)3:28\nLinode 4 coresError\nLinode 8 cores11:48\nLinode 16 cores4:46\n\nAll Linode instances are ‘Dedicated CPU’ instances. On the ‘Linode 4’ instance,sbt was often killed by the OS when running alongside VS Code.\nLet’s be realistic, the performance is worse. The fastest Linode test, using the 16 cores machine, is over 1 minute slower than a test using a local environment. Unless you have a remote server you own and with a decent cpu, you are going to lose at least some performance. But it’s not too terrible.\n\nEnter Hydra\nRemember that we are trying to find a way to run compilation in remote servers for cases where a local setup is not an option. Maybe we can improve on it? Triplequote offers Hydra, a parallel compiler for Scala. This would increase costs, but can this turn it into a viable alternative?\nWe followed the instructions for a trial with Hydra and we run the tests again in Linode. The trial license uses a Developer (Enterprise) license which can take advantage of up to 8 cores.\nMachine (with Hydra)Avg\nLinode 8 cores6:39\nLinode 16 cores1:30\n\nWe can see Hydra makes a big difference as it is able to take advantage of the number of cores available. In the lower spec Linode we halve the compile time, while in the Linode with 16 cores we compile cats in a third of the time it originally took. The improvements would be similar in a local setup, but let’s remember that we are looking at scenarios where you need (want) to use a remote setup.\n\nCost of the setup\nA MacBook Pro 16“ 2019, with the maximum RAM (64 Gb) and CPU (8 core 2.4 Ghz) currently costs $3,799.00, taxes aside. Other non-Apple laptops and desktops will be cheaper, but I use this as a reference as it is the one many companies give to their developers, so it is a fair benchmark for comparison.\nA Linode (Dedicated CPU) with 8 cores and 16 Gb RAM costs USD0.18/hour. For a standard work schedule of 45h per week and 50 weeks per year (and you should really work less than that), it adds up to USD8.1 per week, and USD405 for the year. Assuming the same use pattern, a Linode with 16 cores and 32 Gb of RAM (USD0.36/hr) costs twice as much: $16.2 per week, USD910 per year.\nA Developer - Enterprise license for Hydra costs $1,080/year per seat, to take advantage of up to 8 cores.\nThe slower Linode with 8 cores, with Hydra, would cost $1,485/year but it is twice as slow as the laptop we compare it with, which makes it a less appealing choice. Without Hydra the compilation times become too high to even consider it as an option.\nBut with the Linode 16 cores the story changes, as the performance is closer to what we get with a local machine. You could pay USD910 for the Linode instance and get compile times around 30% slower, but at 25% of the cost of the laptop. Or, if you add Hydra and increase the cost to USD1,990, you can be 60% faster than the laptop for around 50% of the price.\n\nConclusions\nIs it cloud computing ready to become your development server? As with most things in development, it depends. If you need to squeeze every bit of performance\nfrom your machines, then a local setup is still preferred. And you should get a Hydra license, period.\nBut if not, you can get reasonable performance from dedicated machines. A Linode with 16 cores and without Hydra is a quarter of the price of a top of the shelf laptop,\nand you still get reasonable performance. If you add Hydra on top, then we are looking at remote setups that outperform a local setup, while costing you less upfront. A hard-to-beat proposition.\nThere are multiple caveats, of course. For example, the SSH extension for Visual Studio Code is still on preview and there may be glitches. Also, things that are easily achieved with a local workflow may be slightly more complicated with a remote one.\nBut not many project will be as demanding as cats for compilation, due to its multiple compile targets. And there are other possible benefits, like being to replace docker services running locally by ones in remote servers, reducing pressure on the computer even more. Given that we would expect costs for\ncloud computing to decrease as time goes by, this setup can only become better as time goes by. Yes, it is unlikely to beat a local setup on raw performance, but sometimes that is not the only constraint.\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Twitter/Email is more than welcome.

With the advent of devices like the new iPad or the Nexus 7, predictions that mobile will surpass desktop in 2014 seem wrong: it may happen even earlier. I find myself, loving desktops as I do, using Internet on my mobile more and more often. That constant access to the net is so handy…\n\nBut as a web developer this provides a new challenge: your site needs to work properly both in Mobile and Desktop browsers (and in all the flavours of each: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE, etc.). Not so long ago this was solved by having two versions of your site, a mobile one and the classic one, where you redirected the user to the correct one as per their browser (and the mobile site was usually a poorer experience).\nGiven the new relevance of the mobile versions of the site for the companies, that approach wasn’t sustainable. The model has evolved and currently there is a lot of buzz around two concepts that replace it: Mobile first and Responsive Layouts.\nResponsive Layout defines a site whose interface adapts to the size of the view-port of the client. That is, instead of redirecting the user to a version or another according to the browser used, we use CSS media queries to hide or show elements of the page according to the size of the browsing window.\nThis means that we can have only one version of our web application, providing the minimal information necessary to a browser with a tiny view-port (usually mobile, but it could be a resized desktop browser) while adding more details for bigger browsers. You can see the concept in action in this site.\nBut Responsive Layout doesn’t come without its own set of problems. The most common one is that small browser windows usually correspond to devices with a poorer network connection when compared to desktops. While hiding elements via CSS simplifies the UX of the site, the elements are still being sent to the device which translates, in many cases, into a very slow experience.\nMobile First is a concept that tries to reduce the impact of this issue. Instead of designing a desktop site that hides elements when the browser window is smaller, we design the site for the tiniest device (mobile) and we display more elements if the view-port is bigger. Progressive enhancement applied.\nThe combination of both concepts, Responsive Layout and Mobile First, allows us to create our web application once and, with a minimal extra effort, we will be able to provide a better experience to both Mobile and Desktop users. It has the additional benefit of focussing on the minimal functionality required (Mobile First) which may help to reduce clutter on some sites.\n\nExample\nSo, how about an example? I’ve created a very simple web application (in Play 2.0, obviously!) that may help to better understand the concepts behind these two trends. The source code can be found in Github. Download it and I’ll be explaining the code next.\n\nThe application has two content areas. A sidebar in the left that is only visible on a desktop environment and which loads a set of results from Google News, and a main area that contains a bit of text explaining the application plus a set of images obtained from Gravatar. There is also a colour border around the body, coloured red for a browser with a “desktop” size. Simple, but it should be enough to showcase the ideas behind the concepts discussed above.\nThe application uses 3 different techniques to manage 3 elements of the application:\n\n\nCSS Media Queries are used to select the colour of the border around the body of the page. As you resize the browser horizontally the colour should change when you cross one of the thresholds set. These thresholds are also used to show or hide the sidebar. These changes are dynamically applied when you resize the browser, but on the other hand they don’t reduce the amount of content downloaded on page request.\n\n\nConditional load for the contents of the sidebar. The list of news items in the sidebar are loaded via a query to Google News. As the sidebar may not be displayed in some browsers, we only execute the query when the viewport is bigger than a given value. This check only happens when we load the page, so if the content wasn’t loaded and the browser is then resized so the sidebar becomes visible, the user won’t see the news items but some default text that allows the user to access the same content by launching a Google query, so we don’t “punish” the user for resizing the browser by removing access to content.\n\n\nDelayed load for the images in the main area. We could use img tags in the page when rendering it but that would mean that the browser will have to launch multiple requests (one per image) while loading the page. With this technique we mark some anchor tags with metadata and, once the page has been loaded, we inject the img tags into the page. The images will be loaded at that point, but the site itself will be already working and the user can interact with it even in slower connections. We can also modify the size of the image we display according to the viewport so the user downloads a smaller version in devices with potentially worse connections. As with conditional load, this only works on the request, resizing the browser won’t launch the script again.\n\n\nNow that we know what is being done, let’s go into the relevant parts of the code.\nThe application uses 2 templates: main.scala.html provides some common behaviour (like css and javascript files) while index.scala.html contains the relevant code of the demo. The application is using Twitter Bootstrap for the base layout. Some code (like Modernizr usage) is not explained in this post but the demo contains some comments about it.\nTo enable the responsive layout from Bootstrap I add in main.html the following:\n\nThis will ensure that the browser doesn’t try to fake the viewport size on the request, while still allowing for zooming in mobile devices.\nIn index.scala.html I declare the basic layout with the two areas of the page. I use a fluid layout from Bootstrap plus one of the responsive styles (visible-desktop) which will hide the sidebar if the browser is less than 968px wide.\n\nThe styles file, main.css, contains a set of media queries that will change the border around the body of the page according to the size of the browser:\n\nUp to here  there are elements that will be downloaded always, whatever the viewport size, and may change behaviour dynamically as you resize your browser. Many responsive layouts stop here, but if the sidebar contained a lot of data and images, that would penalize mobile users by forcing them to download extra content they’ll never see.\nTo solve this we add a minimal amount of content to the sidebar, so if a user resizes the browser and sees it doesn’t get a white gap with no content (progressive enhancement):\n\nand then we add some javascript magic to load the real content dynamically via Conditional Loading. In this example the content loaded is the result of a query to Google News. The details on the retrieval of the data are not relevant to this post. What’s relevant is this part of the code (excerpt):\n\nThis fragment will wait until the page has been loaded (equivalent to jquery’s $(document).ready ) and then check the window size. If the size corresponds to a desktop browser (in which the Bootstrap style visible-desktop will stop hiding the sidebar) then the search is triggered and the content added to the sidebar. Otherwise nothing happens.\nThis means that for a mobile user there will be no extra work done (besides a simple javascript check) as the information would not be shown, improving the loading time of the page. The fact that the check is done after the main content is ready is also relevant, as the user can start interacting with the main page immediately when in a desktop, and the additional data (which is less relevant to the user) will be loaded in the meantime.\nLet’s talk now about the images displayed in the main area and Delayed Loading. In this sample  around 500 images are loaded at once in that section. This could be, in reality, the comments area of a popular blog with lots of comments (and their corresponding images).\nFollowing the naïve approach the html would be rendered with 500 img tags, which would cause the browser to load these images in parallel to the rest of the page, delaying the “ready” status of the page. In Delayed Loading javascript, triggered once the document has loaded, is used to modify the Html DOM. This way the images are loaded later, once the page is ready and functional for the user. This approach also gives extra control on the size of the images loaded.\nThe relevant code follows:\n\nWith this code a proper image size (as per the browser size) is selected when the page is ready, and then the img tags are injected into the corresponding placeholders. The result is a delayed loading of secondary content that speeds up the page for the user, providing a better experience specially in slow networks.\nTo see the impact of these modifications on the page load, see the following network analysis done by Chrome:\n\nAs you can see, the page has 2 main blocks of request. The first one corresponds to the basic content of the page (html, css, javascript) and takes less than 300ms. At this point the page is ready and the user can interact with it. The second block starts then and corresponds to the delayed requests, taking additional 315ms.\nIn this simple example we get to the “ready” status 50% faster. As you can see, this can be a huge benefit for more complex pages, providing the best UX possible to their customers. Worth the extra effort :)\nFeel free to add any comments on the subject below!\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/responsive-design-and-mobile-first/","title":"Responsive Design and Mobile First"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/running-llm-on-your-own/":{"body":"I’ve written a new blog post, a collaboration with Chaordic, that you can read in their blog: Running LLMs on your own.

I will be updating this entry with summaries on the talks I attended. Typos a plenty, be warned, but I hope this proves useful to somebody while we wait for the videos to be made available. You can also read my summary of day two.\n\nKeynote: Scaling Intelligence: moving ideas forward\nBy Jessica Kerr\nScala as a language is about scaling. There is an inherent limit on development: what fits in our head (see this other talk by Jessica Kerr and Dan North). Given that limit, we need to scale outside of ourselves, use our team and community. People learn best in teams, people are not superstars by themselves, great teams create stars.\nMost of what we do is not coding, nor learning, but teaching. We teach computer what to do, teach business about their own process (via requirement gathering), teach users via the UI we build, and we teach each other. Reusable code, flexible code, that is learnable code. A good commit message, that teaches what intention is behind the change. Documentation teaches what something does.\nWe want people in our community as only that way we can scale that knowledge that makes us better. There are two things we need to know about Scala which we can only learn from members and group diversity:\n\nClarity: a teacher looks at the context of the learner, appreciates that context and adapts to that to teach. If something is not clear to you is not your fault, it is being explained wrong.\nUsefulness: if code is not useful then it doesn’t matter how correct it is. Determined by aggregate support of the community.\n\nScala is designed to scale the community. Scala is supposed to be a staircase, to start by using features that make more sense to us and gradually learn more things and advance. But currently you can hit roadblocks due to lack of context when trying to learn something, which forces you to learn stuff you do’t care about not or you are not ready to tackle.\nYou should write blogs, even for very basic information. Writing blogs helps less experienced people to find solutions to problems when they Google the error and they learn why something is that way. If many people do this we accelerate the community and help moving to next step in the language.\nDocumentation written by leaders or experts of a community that know too much on the subject is too sparse as they have too much context. They can’t scale a community themselves. New joiners, with less experience, can help because they can identify what context is needed for an explanation. Scala can be hard, don’t feel stupid for nto understanding! Write and collaborate.\nYour contribution is valuable. If something (blog post, stack overflow question) helps you, writing a post pointing to it and saying that helped you and how it was useful makes Google raise its relevance and helps the community to find it easily, helping all. Writing that makes you part of Scala. A language by itself doesn’t do anything, Scala is part of a programming system that includes libraries, tools, editors, AND the community.\nWe can learn a lot from the Ruby community (and they can learn about language form us :P) It is a community that has scaled and it is still growing, still writing very useful software in it. We can learn on how they interact with each other, we can bring the same community scale to us.\nWe can learn things like:\n\n\nScala values evolution vs stability. Ruby solved this dilema because libraries have a lot of maintainers, so they can be upgraded and evolve while being stable. In Scala with Typesafe, Typelevel you are still good. But other groups (Twitter, Foursquare, etc) which have few maintainers you are at risk, you don’t know when will they use newer idioms.\n\n\nWhat is idiomatic scala? Still not clear, everybody’s Scala is different, and we spend time arguing about this while people leaves the community. We need to find a way, and only the community can do that, no one can tell us, no other community can offer us the solution. Ruby found a way to solve this issue and developed common idioms, we can too. Ruby spent time where people was reading each other’s useful code (business code, not library code), which helps spreading knowledge.\n\n\nYou should approach code with humility and respect for the reader. Be a teacher. For example: always include imports on your code examples and be explicit on the imports you use (not just ._). Give context.\nBeware symbolic representations.They make things harder than necessary. Words are clearer than symbols and can be Googled, so really make sure that symbol is necessary. Naming in scala is a very strong asset, we should use this power more. Naming is hard, but then if it is hard, do it more! It is hard because you need to think about the problem you solve. So do it.\nAvoid words like simply, obviously, etc… They tell you are supposed to know something you may not know. As a teacher, help the students by being more clear, providing links, helping to set a context for the action. Use\nUse Stack Overflow. Write blog posts. All that helps the community. We need to discuss not only the language and FP but also code style, tools, etc. Don’t just show syntax, teach me why is that option better, what is the concept behind. Make documentation better and more complete.\nAccept help from newer users. Saying ‘no, that is not the right way’ to a pull request you have closed the door of the community to that person. Accept pull-requests, even more so for documentation. If it is not great, help that person to improve but don’t shut the community’s door to new joiners.\nAssuming context or acting like someone is stupid for not knowing context is a bad idea. That will alienate people and hurt us as a group. Don’t define scala documentation in terms of learn you a Haskell. If you learn scala you want to learn Scala in Scala’s context, asking me to learn Haskell is not the way. Don’t ask me to learn category theory to write a useful business application. Give me the context I need to do what I want.\nFinally, publish boring Scala code that teaches business domain and how to build useful things to the community. Use that hashtag  #blueSkyScala to spread that knowledge to the community.\n\n\nFunctional Patterns for FP beginners\nBy Clément Delafargue\n(Note: you should watch the video once released to see more detailed examples on the concepts)\nFunctional programmer, day to day work with Javascript, but what I learned from Scala helped to write better JS. This talk is about simple patterns for FP. Not common abstractions like Functors or Monads, no Category Theory, but the tools we can use to build these abstractions. This is a way (of many possible) to do these things. Customise it to your needs.\nScala documentation in FP refers mostly to Haskell documentation, but if you don’t know Haskell that is a problem. Here we want to avoid that and focus on common FP patterns.\nFP (functional programming) being ‘programming with values’, where everything is an expression and you tweak values to get to the desired result. For example if is not a block anymore, is an expression that returns a value. Pattern match is not a substitute for switch, is a way to produce a value.\nWe have Typed FP in Scala. All your expressions have types and you can type check the results, letting the compiler check the control flow and ensure correctness.\n\nAlgebraic data types (ADT)\nWe use Algebraic Design, where you start with values, combine values and get desired values. Your workflow is data driven. So how do we model the data? Via Algebraic data types (ADT).\nAlgebraic because they have two properties:\n\nProduct types: compound type created by combining two or more types. Example: Tuple; case class User(name: String, age: Int)\nSum types (or Co-products): a simple example is a Json value, which can be either a string, object, array or number. A Sum type is a group of values. In Scala this is implemented via a sealed trait and we use pattern matching to work with them (deconstruct and inspect structure). Example:\n\n\nPattern matching raises compiler warnings if you forget a member of the Sum, which is handy. In Scala you can also combine Sum types to share elements across types. An example is Json is ‘root elements’ or Json values (which can be only object or array) vs all possible Json elements.\n\nOOP makes it easy to add cases, while FP makes it easy to add functions. Compiler helps in both cases, but there is a trade-off for the developer. Thankfully in Scala you can choose the way you want to implement things as it gives both options.\nShould you hand roll your own ADT or use generic types (like tuples or Either)? ADT are preferred unless you are deconstructing the result right away, as when the application grows your own ADT will help you more (compiler works for you).\nSum and Product types keep properties of mathematical sum and product, like associativity, exponentials and factorisation. We have neutral value (Unit). For example:\n\nThese are equivalent but one gives more information via types:\n\nPlease void booleans in ADT, you want to use the types to provide information. Types make you more precise and allow compiler to type check.\nADT are used to do Domain Driven Design, where you observe your data and build domain based on that. Much better than POJOs.\n\nProgramming with Contextualised Values\nWe can program expressing into types if a computation failed, is asynchronous, etc.\n\nError handling\nOption type is useful when only one thing can go wrong. For example when you parse String to Integer, there is no need of extra precision. It is simple to use, but restricted, if many things can go wrong you are losing information.\nEither is a Sum type (Left -&gt; Error, Right -&gt; value) which allows you to handle several errors cases. Please use ADT to describe errors as Strings provide less information on the error type. With ADT you can handle all error cases. Beware Either is not biased in Scala and doesn’t work too well with type inference. You can use Disjunction from Scalaz which behaves better and it’s biased (defaults to Right and provides flatMap operation to use inside a for-comprehension).\nIf chained, both Either and Disjunction fail on the first error. Sometimes you want to accumulate errors, then you should use Validation from Scalaz. The error list is a NonEmptyList to ensure we have error messages on failure.\nSometimes you want to accumulate errors, some times you want to fail on first error. Don’t flatten your errors, decide what is what you want.\n\nExtend types\nType Monoid allows you to combine 2 values and provides a neutral element. With subclassing you can’t declare a Zero element or extend Standard library classes (they are final). The workaround is to use traits that provide the desired behaviour and that you pass as additional parameter to functions.\nTo avoid the work of explicitly passing that new type as a parameter, you declare the new type as implicit so the compiler autowires the proper implementation. Just be careful with Typeclass convergence where a type could have multiple implementations of the same behaviours, which causes problems.\nSimulacrum library helps you creating typeclasses and boilerplate for these types.\n(see examples from the talk when the video is published)\nRecommended to read Cats code as it is simple code and will help you understand.\nFinal tips as we are running out of time:\n\nUse property testing for everything\nSeparate effects from logic (Free Monads?)\nRead FP in Scala book\n\n\n\nBuilding a CQRS application using the Scala Type System and Akka\nBy Renato Cavalcanti\nContent of talk comes from current work done by Renato for the Belgium Government, so real world problems and lessons.\nCQRS: the idea behind is to have 2 objects, one which accepts commands and produces events, another object which receives the events and generates views on the model. If you don’t use event sourcing you need to produce event and save both write and read model in same transaction, otherwise you will lose event and data. If the commit fails, you have a problem. That is why event sourcing is important, as events can be stored and replayed.\n\nCommand\nReplaying events is very powerful, as you can use the stored events from production in a test environment to check all your components work as expected and produce the desired results. Facilitates verification of code.\nThe talk will show how to use CQRS in Akka, please watch video for full code examples. The examples uses mostly Akka-Http and Akka-Stream, two solutions for pretty well defined domains that help building the solution. The problem with Akka is that Akka is in fact a function to =&gt; Any, which means you lose type safety and has its own problems.\nThe solution is to build something on top of Akka that isolates you from these issue. You find the building blocks of a CQRS system, following DDD: DomainCommand, DomainEvent and Aggregate. These are traits that help you define your building blocks.\nWe also define some functions to validate events (which return a Future) and to construct Aggregates from DomainEvents.\nThat solved, we have another issue to tackle. We need to persist the events, which we can do via Akka Persistence. We don’t store the message received in the actor, but the event generated as reaction to that message. If an Aggregate (implemented as an actor) is restarted, it can recover its status from reading the chain of events in the event-store.\nBut for all this to work we need a Protocol, a set of command and events for a given Aggregate. We also define the Behaviour (mapping between commands and events). We can create a DSL to facilitate generating Behaviours for an Aggregate.\n[Renato now shows code showcases the implementation of a Protocol, the corresponding Behaviour DSL and an Aggregate. Please watch video for more details]\nIf I have Aggregate, Protocol and Behaviour then I can create an AggregateManager, an Actor, that creates AggregateActors and manages its life-cycle. Your AggregateService is fully typed, via the protocol, and the Manager abstracts the Akka details from you.\n\nQuery\nThe Query side is about reading the events and producing Views on the data. We use Akka Persistence Query, an experimental feature. An actor generates a Projection from the events, so we don’t need to recalculate the status every time (snapshot-style). Each projection has an id to identify it and provide versioning. The actor doesn’t accept new events while generating a Projection, only after it has finished.\n[Renato now shows code of the Query part of the system]\nThe Projection object is not typed, as usually you handle multiple events in a single projection. A future improvement is to strongly type projections, but not there yet. A Projection also has more data than the Aggregate stores, as there may be inferred data that is valuable for the business when viewing data, but we don’t need to store explicitly.\nThe DSL used by Renato also provides methods to watch a Projection, so we can detect events and, for example, wait until all events required are received before generating a projection result.\n\nTakeways\nGiven a Protocol, Behaviour and Aggregate then you can have an actor that understand the life-cycle and a fully typed AggregateService.\nCommand validations can usually be asynchronous, but events must be pure and always succeed.\n\n\nKeynote: Without Resilience, Nothing Else Matters\nBy Jonas Bonér\nIf your application is not available, doing something useful, nothing else matters: quality, speed, etc.\n“It isn’t about how hard you hit, is about how hard can you be hit and keep moving forward. […] That’s how winning is done.” (from Rocky Movie)\nFault tolerance is not enough. Resilience is beyond fault tolerance, and it’s all that matters. Resilience is the ability to spring back into shape, to recover quickly from difficulties. Software today can be incredibly complex, and we need to understand resilience in the context of these complex systems.\nA complicated system has multiple small parts that interact to do something. It can be understood, although it is hard. A complex system is made of many similarly interacting parts with simple rules (ala Game of Life). Those rules define emerging properties which are impossible to understand. You can understand individual rules, but not the full interactions and outcomes. Complicated is not the same a Complex.\nComplex systems run in degraded mode. Complex systems run as broken systems. In a Complex system there is something failing somewhere, always! And humans make things worse, as complex systems are counterintuitive and when we use intuition we usually end up worsening the existing issues.\nComplex systems operate at the edge of failure. There is the economic failure boundary, where you can run out of business. There is the unacceptable workload boundary where you can’t cope with the work. There is the accident boundary, when an undefined event causes us to fail. The operating point moves between these boundaries, and if it crosses one of them we fail.\nThis means we have 3 pressures on the operating point. Management tries to minimise economic failure, workload tends to least effort, and as a result we are pushing the point towards the accident boundary which is undefined. We try to counteract with tools, systems, but this keeps happening as we can’t understand all implications. The only solution is to add an error margin to protect us from failure, so when we get into dangerous territory we can act before we fail.\nThe problem is that we don’t know much, if anything, about the failure boundary so it is hard to define a proper error boundary. And we keep pushing it closer to the failure boundary as the system looks stable to us, until the point where the boundary is not helping anymore and we fail.\nWe must embrace failure. We know complex systems always work as broken system, so we need to accept failure as normality. We must understand that resilience is by design, it can’t be bolted in afterwards.\n“In the animal kingdom simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience”. Complexity may help building resilience. Another example on how complexity builds resilience is how the current world protects us: it feeds us, give sus shelter, etc. And it is very complex. So we can learn about resilience in both biological and social systems:\n\nFeature diversity and redundancy\nInterconnected network structure\nWide distribution\nCapacity to self-adapt and self-organise\n\nHow does this apply to computer systems? We need to change the way we manage failure. Failure is natural and expected. One way: Let it crash, like Erlang does.\nSo we have Crash Only software (name of a paper). Stop is equal to crash safely. Start is equal to recover fast from a crash. We can apply this recursively and turn the big sledgehammer into a scalpel to tolerate failures at many levels. It is recommended to read the paper.\nWe need a way out of the ‘State Tar Pit’ (another paper). A lot of failure is related to data (partial data, wrong data, etc). We have input data, provided by customers, and derived data, data we compute from the input data. The critical one is input data, that we need to keep and take care of to avoid annoying users.\nIn the traditional way of managing state a error at the end of an input path will cause all the path to fail and we will lose the input data, which is an utterly broken way to manage this. We react to this by abusing defensive programming, adding try-catch blocks everywhere, etc.\n“Accidents come from relationships, not broken parts.” A Sane failure model means that Failures need to be:\n\nContained to avoid cascading failures\nReified as messages\nSignalled asynchronously\nObserved by at least 1 actor, up to N observers\n\nBasically, the bulkhead pattern used by ship industry. If a compartment breaks the ship is not affected. But we can still do better, by adding Supervision: observe and manage failures from a healthy context. Components that fail should notify the Supervisor so something can be done about it. An ‘Onion Later State &amp; Failure management’ or ‘Error Kernel pattern’. The kernel delegates all work and supervises so the task is performed correctly, managing any errors as necessary. We apply this recursively, with a layer managing failures of the underlying level.\nWe can’t put all eggs in same basket. We need to maintain diversity and redundancy. Servers crash, AWS goes down. We need multiple servers, even multiple data centers, which means running a distributed system. And they should be decoupled in time (to enable concurrency) and space (enables mobility of nodes). This gives a very solid base for resilience.\nWe need to decompose systems using consistency boundaries. We need to think about isolation of components. We need to start with the weakest consistency guarantees we can, and add stronger ones as we go if we need them. The less ACID and coordination you need, the better. Within the boundary we can have strong consistency (example: actors are single threaded with an inbox). Between boundaries it is a ‘zoo’, all bets are off, we need to manage failure as described above. But that is good, as weak coupling and other properties of the ‘zoo’ enhance our resilience.\nRemember: strong consistency is the wrong default, it adds too strong coupling, but what we need is to decompose systems and create safe islands (consistency boundaries).\nTo conclude, let’s talk about resilient protocols, the way to manage the ‘zoo’ outside consistency boundaries. They depends on asynchronous communication and eventual consistency. They must embrace ACID 2.0 (Associative, Commutative, Idempotent, Distributed); they must be tolerant to message loss, reordering, and duplication.\nRemember: Complex systems run as borken systems. Something is always failing. Resilience is by design. Without resilience, nothing else matters.\n\n\nA purely functional approach to building large applications\nBy Noel Markham\nThis talks follow a bit on his talk last year about ‘Introduction to Scalaz’. We will look at tools and techniques and how to do things in a more purely functional manner. (Talk will be heavy on screen-coding, so please watch the video! I will try to summarise the concepts explained, but without seeing the code it may not make too much sense)\nStart by breaking rules and using import scalaz._; import Scalaz._ and other generic imports. Sorry Jessica Kerr ;)\nStarting point are a couple of API which are not too flexible but we can’t modify, they are external API.\nFirst concept: let’s talk about Markov Chains. We want to build a structure to, given 2 words, try to guess what would be the next word and a function that would use that to generate possible sentences. We could use a method that returns a Future, and use Await.result over the external API and then use the result to the generator. We can improve that by using a for-comprehension.\nWe can improve the code more by extracting the configuration. Side concept: we can compose functions (f andThen g), but a function can be considered a Functor, so it can be mapped over! So we can group all our configuration into a case class and create functions Config =&gt; String or Config =&gt; Int to extract config. And we can group those functions to extract several values at once. We can go further and use functions as Monads to extract config (via the functions) using a for-comprehension.\nGiven all we did above, we can create functions that given a config (as a parameter) return a function that will return what we want (tweets, other data). We can do the same for the string generator, to make it depend on config. And then we can use both in a for-comprehension as functions are Monads, although we still have the Future type around.\nWe can tackle that Future type by wrapping the function with a Reader type. Then we need to understand the concept of Monad transformers, which allows us to unwrap a monad to interact with it’s element. For example, given a Future[Option[Int]] we can interact with the Option directly, without having to call a method in Future. In Scalaz that would be OptionT[Future, Int]. Given Monad transformers, we can then work with ReaderT which will allow us to ignore the Future in our methods until we really want to. This gives us a ReaderT[Future, String, Int] which allows us to work with all the elements of our computation independently (kleisli).\nGoing back to our example, we can then change our functions to become kleisli for ReaderT[Future, Config, List[Tweet]] or ReaderT[Future, Config, String]. We have separated constituent types and we can deal with each one as we need to. Which helps us produce a very sane for-comprehension, very legible and understandable. And we get as result a Future[String] but that is at the end of the calculation, so we block at a point after we defined all the task to do, decoupling task from execution.\nAn advantage is that this makes this code easier to test. Our methods take functions as arguments, a home-grown dependency injection system where we can plug anything we want (respecting types!) so we can test the code without interacting with 3rd party services or doing other steps of the process. No need to mock, just use simple stubs.\nA suggestion to test is to use ScalaCheck. With ScalaCheck you suggest properties for your code, and the framework makes sure your properties hold by trying to find values that break them. (Also adding a dash of Shapeless, because why not). With this we can, for example, make sure our code doesn’t modify the text of the tweets in any way by default.\nWe can still do better, let’s try to abstract over ReaderT. Right now we are only using ReaderT as Mond, so we may as well replace it by M[List[Tweet]] and M[String] on our functions. Our for-comprehension doesn’t change, but it has other benefits. For example, our test code can be simpler as we can use the Id (identity) monad to generate values.\nLet’s say we now want to add logging to it. How can we tackle this? Let’s assume we are given a method log that returns a Future. We can integrate this as a parameter String =&gt; M[Unit] and we are done. Except we don’t like side-effects and Unit. We can wrap the log in a Writer which allows us to do an operation and do an additional operation into a secondary store (basically, a log). With this we replace our Reader by Writer to integrate the logging, but both are Monads so the signatures and for-comprehension don’t change, only implementation details. (Note: I may have missed some detail in that last part! Check the video.)\nAfter all this process, we found nice ways to provide configuration, wire functions (akin to dependency injection) and abstract over Monads, all by leveraging the power of libraries like Scalaz, Shapeless, and ScalaCheck. And by using the libraries you reduce boilerplate and make code easier to understand.\nImportant Note: you really need to see the slides with the code to follow the talk fully, very recommended talk if you are interested in FP.\n\n\nExploiting Dependent Types for Safer, Faster Code\nBy Jon Pretty\nThis is an advanced feature of Scala’s type system. Not difficult to use, but writing libraries that use them can be complex.\nThe ‘Slippery road’ represent a dynamic language, where you can’t control the types and you have no guidance. Throughout the talk an example library will be used: Raptured command-line.\nExample: a bash command\n\nWe would like to convert that to Scala. We can try to parse the arguments into Scala values. We may even specify a type parameter so the parsing doesn’t return a String but an Int. We may want to use several representations for a value (-s, –size). All this an be abstracted further into a value of type Param[Int]('s', \"size\"). Nothing too exciting.\nLet’s stash that for a moment and talk about Rapture I18N, a library to support I18N Strings in apps. The standard solution is to use string bundles, one per language, managed separately from the code itself. But what if you forget to add a translation for a sentence in a language? You get a runtime error. Rapture I18N embeds the languages in the source and makes the compiler check for completeness.\n(Some examples of Rapture I18N follow)\nA type behind Rapture I18N is:\n\nThat gives us a type intersection, a type per language, and we track the contents of an IString as if it was a map of language type to string. The intersection type En with De means the type is both an En and a De. In Scala we can create an intersection between any two types, for example: Int with String. A type can exists even if we can’t have instance of it.\nThese kind of types are called phantom types which exist purely for compiler benefit, they will never be instantiated. After compilation they get erased, they don’t exist in bytecode (type erasure). But the compiler can use them to enforce constraints on other types and to drive implicit resolution.\nFor example we can use the constraint enforce to make sure sayHi[Ru] will fail compilation if we didn’t define a Ru version of Hi. We can do that by requiring a supertype of the phantom type V &gt;:T. Given En with De, En is a supertype and will compile, but Ru is not a supertype and it will fail compilation.\nAs all accesses are checked at compile time, we know they are safe operations and total functions, which we know won’t fail. But we don’t know which times we are going to access at compile time, we will know at runtime time. How can we convert the string indicating language from the user into a type? What if they send a request for a language that doesn’t exist?\nWe can write parsers like (en | de).parse(inputLang) which becomes the only point of failure at runtime. We can’t avoid that, but all the rest of the code has been checked at compile time, so we know we can handle the exceptional cases in there and do not worry anymore about I18N types. Narrowing failure points is good for programming.\n(Quick demo on Rapture I18N follows)\nAfter the demo, back to the Command Line problem stated at the start. We want to enforce some constrains on the parameters passed to a command line instruction. We can do it naively via pattern matching and for comprehension, but could do better and try to reduce this to a single point of failure as we did with the I18n library.\nWe potentially have a complex structure of conjunctions and disjunctions over parameter preferences and alternative representations. We can represent them in Scala types, so A &amp; B &amp; C becomes Product[A with B with C]. A | B | C becomes CoProduct[A with B with C]. And then we define combinators for | and &amp; (see slides for definitions, basically pattern matching grouping parameters into Product or CoProduct instances). The result will be a complex type built following the defined combinations.\nWith these definitions we can do as we did with I18N, reducing the point of failure to parse (Note: you will need to see the slides/video to follow the code that generates all this, can’t reproduce in this summary).\nIn summary: multiple failure points increase the burden on error handling. Instead we want to handle all failures together, up-front. Use total functions and many more operations are now dafe, with more code becoming free of distracting error handling. We have reduced the surface of failure.\nPredictions: dependent types will be increasingly important in the future of typed languages. Work will be around make it easier to write. In Scala, error messages CAN be improved, we can have better tooling to manage them. Hopefully we will have more code that consists entirely of total functions, with very reduce surface for error. Lastly, this additional information provided by the types can offer opportunities to improve performance.\n\n\nLighting Talks - Track 1\nBy Andrew (Gus) Gustafson - Making your life easier with macros\nProblem: write out a class using snake case JSON field names. By default you need to override a method provided by some JSON library to provide what you want. Or for example, if you want to convert an ADT to JSON, to process the parent sealed trait you need a (potentially big) pattern match for every possible child.\nMacros are a simple way to generate this ‘boilerplate’ code, following a DRY principle. Write macro once, apply everywhere, without duplicating code.\nTips and Tricks for Macros:\n\nprintln is your friend. Auto-complete too. Keep typing until something good happens\nmacro code needs to be in a separate codebase than your domain model\n\n(Code example follows)\n\nLighting Talks - Track 1\nBy Jamie Pullar - Handling Partially Dynamic Data\nSubtitle: exploring a DSL approach to lenses with Jsentric and Dsentric.\nExamples of partially dynamic data:  given a JSON object we validate only fields of interest in the server. Or microservices supporting arbitrary content structures, they only care about specific fields and ignore the rest of the data.\nThe first challenge: how do we deserialise data to work with it? Use type safe structures (ADT vs Map[String, Any]).\nHow to extract the data we want? We can use Lenses to extract the fields we want. Lenses allow us to target parts of the data and operate with it. The issue is that it can become a bit unwieldy code wise.\nTo solve code verbosity we introduce a Contract structure, which defines the structure we care about. Then we can use it to pattern match over the input data (for example JSON) and work with the relevant values, while not relevant data is silently ignored. The Contract allows us to read, modify, and delete the relevant values. Using Shapeless we can improve usability by providing helpers which reduce boilerplate even more.\nWe can extend the Contract to add validations, as precise as we need (example: age &gt; 0 and &lt; 150). These validations can be type safe. Further extension allows us to build querying over the structures, so we can filter the data. All this is possible because the Contract is abstracting the data structure from our business logic.\nDsentric is custom contract configuration with Monocle.\n\nLighting Talks - Track 1\nBy Mikael Valot - Flexible data structures in Scala\n(Talk heavy on code examples, check slides for more clarity)\nProject Strucs. Case classes are not composable. How can I define common fields only once without using Shapeless records?\nStructs enables you to concatenate case classes via + operator to generate new types. So you can create one case class per each field, and concatenate to generate a composite type. Compiler checks to avoid field duplication. You can compose these struct types, so having a Person and an Address you can then have a Person with Address that includes values of both.\nThese compositions can be used in structural types, so you can define a type parameter T &lt;: Age with Name to ensure type safety of your operations.\nUnder the hood, a Struct is a Struct[F](private val fields: Map[StructKey, Any]), where all access to the map is via parametrised types, for example get[T](implicit k: StructKeyProvider[T], ev: F &lt;:&lt; T): T. This should avoid the issues usually related to using Any.\nStruct enables us to provide automatic JSON encode/decode via macros.\n\nLighting Talks - Track 1\nBy Nick Pollard - More Typing, Less Typing - Driving behaviour with types\nScala has a very powerful type system. What is it good for? Usually we though about Validation, what about generating behaviour? We do that all the time, for example when we overload methods or we use Typeclasses.\nTypeclasses revisited: interface across type, common capability but varied behaviour by type. Each instance provides behaviour, implemented using trait and used via implicit. Instances are defined as implicit values and def. Implicit def can take another implicit as parameter.\nWhen searching for an implicit the compiler can chain successive implicits if it will produce the required type.\nHow can we handle more complex types via implicits? We need an algebra for types. An algebra is just a group of objects and operators you can use on those objects. Like numbers and mathematical operators, or types and type operators.\nHow do we operate on types? What is a type? A type can be seen as a set of values. Example: Boolean is Set(true, false). Char is Set('a', 'b', ...). So we can use Set operators, of which we care about two, product (cartesian product) and coproduct (also named disjoint union, like Scalaz /, or sum).\nWith this we can express types in the terms of operators. Option[A] = () \\/ A.\nIf we can model types as operators in simple types, we can construct typeclasses from that. This is what Shapeless does for this.\nShapeless uses HList (heterogeneous lists). Equivalent to nested tuples (A, (B, C)). The base case is HNil, we can recurse over the list until we hit HNil. Shapeless also provides CoProduct, similar to Tuples of \\/ (simplifying).\nHow is that useful? It allows us, for example, to generate parsers for any type of case class by treating them as HList. Shapeless automatically turns ADTs into HList (it has implicits and macros to do that). This reduces boilerplate, we write a generic parser once and we can apply it to any present or future ADT we use.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-exchange-2015-day-one/","title":"Scala Exchange 2015 Day One"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-exchange-2015-day-two/":{"body":"Scala Exchange 2015 is on!

You can also read my summary of day one.\n\nKeynote: Spark+Hadoop and how it relates to Scala\nBy Sean Owen\nIntends to give a different perspective on Scala, a less technical talk, more about his path into Scala coming from Hadoop and Java.\nSean started with EJB and Struts. Some of these ideas faded after the dot-com bust. Moved to Google, built Barcode scanner in Android. He chose to move towards Java to avoid C++. After Google got involved with open-source in a project that ended up being Apache Mahout. There were ML systems before Hadoop, but Hadoop attracted all those Java developers interested in the area. He worked with it until 2 years ago where he moved to Spark, and Scala.\nThe common thread on most of this path is the JVM. For enterprise people, everything looks like Spring/Maven/etc, the standard stack. Your world view is defined by it, you mold problems to fit that.\nWhy Hadoop in Java, instead of C++ which was used in Google for Map-Reduce? Officially due to the usual reasons: type-safe, garbage colector, easier to debug, libraries available, and platform independence. But Sean thinks there are other reasons: lots of people fled the dot-com burst to the safety of tech giants. Enterprise architecture meets web scale and Hadoop is born. A colleague thinks the real reason is Lucene used Java as an experiment, and Hadoop inherited that decision along the way.\nHadoop has some functional ideas from the start. Map-reduce, HDFS (immutable file system), no side effects in mappers/reducers. They probably were not taken directly from FP, they are just good ideas and assumptions that work well in a distributed environment, almost essential.\nHowever, Hadoop ‘feels’ enterprise-y. For example, a Mapper is a heavy-weight object instead of a simple function. It allows you to store state, exposes threading to you, makes you manage serialisation, etc. There may be reasons behind (performance, etc) but it’s not very functional.\nIn a parallel world, Python grew in the ‘big-data’ environment. Python is different: has an interpreter, sometype inference, has lambdas, libraries for ML, and pip to manage dependencies. Not at all like enterprise software. There are some nice things in the Python environment we wish we could have in the Java world (at that time). But if you are used to Java’s world you won’t realise you may want these things.\nThen we arrive to 2014, where functional invades the Hadoop ecosystem via Spark, Kafka, and Java 8 lambdas. Mentions to Storm and other similars projects that reinforce the trend. So suddenly the JVM has access to some of the features it was lacking.\nBut this is not about Spark replacing Map-reduce unexpectedly, we already had projects (like Crunch) that had improved in that area so the progression is ‘natural’, it has been coming for a while. This is just a next step in the evolution.\nWhy do Scala/Spark fit Hadoop? Many reasons:\n\nImmutable data at the foundation, perfect match between FP and Hadoop\nFunctional paradigm from the start\nUnlocks caching due to immutability, at all levels from Spark to HDFS\nScala naturally from Java, which in turn replaced C++. Natural progression\nHybrid imperative/functional wins, easier to adapt to and quickly grab benefits\nMemory caching allows for fast iteration, which benefits data scientists as iteration is at the core of ML\nThe provided Shell allows for exploratory analytics, makes it easier to prototype\nIt’s more familiar to Python devs and the environment/features they are used to\n\nWhat do I like about Scala as a former Java developer?\n\nLove collections, say what you will but they give you a lot of expressiveness\nLove case classes and tuples, save you a lot of boilerplate\nLove language constructs like val, lazy and match. They simplify and clarify what you intend to write\nLove closures, which are much better than Java 8 lambdas, cleaner and slicker\n\nWhat do I dislike about Scala as a former Java developer?\n\nDislike Option, not sure it’s way better than null\nDislikes incompatible minor releases, has been very painful in Spark. A big deal for projects\nDislikes Sbt imperative style, still prefers Maven declarative style.

Yes, he understands the Scala compiler does so much more for you, but compiling park takes so long it seems crazy on 2015.\n\nThe last complain about Scala community it’s the excessive fascination with syntax, sometimes using complex functional chain of operations to express simple ideas which could be expressed in a simpler way in Java.\nScala is, no doubt, the future for Hadoop ecosystem. That is good.\n\n\nStreams: reactive? functional? Or: akka- &amp; scalaz- streams side-by-side\nBy Adam Warski\nThe aim of today is to see the differences between Akka and Scalaz streams. Most of the talk will be live coding, so please watch the video.\nThe problem we want to solve is to process data as it comes. We can’t hold all the data into memory for some reason, irrelevant why. We focus on scenarios with a single node which cover a lot of common scenarios, for multi-node computations please check Spark.\nAkka Streams introduces itself as a library to process and transfer a sequence of elements in a bounded buffer space.\nScalaz Streams is a streaming I/O library focussed on compositionally, expressiveness and resource safety.\nIn both cases we want to define a pipeline, in a type-safe way, and then run data through it. Scalaz-stream is slightly more typesafe than Akka Streams. In both libraries the first step is to create a ‘blue-print’ (graph for Akka, process for Scalaz) that defines how to transform the data. After that is defined we can execute it (materialise in Akka, run in Scalaz).\nThe basic building blocks for Akka is a Graph (simple caseL linear pipeline), that has a source (produces elements), Sink (consumes an input) and some Flow pieces that transforms elements. At runtime each component is materialised into an Actor, and each actor does the operation defined in the relevant component. Each component also materialise into an additional value (example: Source into a Future you can use to get the result of the processing).\nIn Scalaz the approach is different. We initially create a data type Process[F[_], T]. T is the output type, F[_] describes side-effects that can occur while processing. In simplest case we have Process[Nothing, T] that emits T without any change. We also have aliases like Sink[F[_],0] = Process[F, O =&gt; F[Unit]]. The Process is in fact akin to a state machine.\nAkka implements the reactive-streams standard, which provides back-pressure via a back-channel, via dynamic push-pull. Source only produces data when the back-channel indicates it is needed, to avoid overwhelming components downstream. Everything is actor based, things happen concurrently.\nScalaz has back-pressure for free as it is entirely pull-based. Elements are evaluated on by one, in a functional approach by which we only process one element once the state machine says we can do so. Not dependent on Scalaz except for Task. To be clear, Scalaz is slower than Akka version (2-3x).\n(Code examples via live-coding start, please watch video. I’ll try to summarise any key ideas mentioned)\nIn Akka operations over the Source (like map or filter) are converted into actors behind the scenes. The first example to manipulate a text file (read, filter, map and save) already creates at least 8 actors. You can’t influence the concurrency.\nCode in Scalaz version looks similar, just using different types as Source. Scalaz calls run twice, first once compiles process into a Task, the second runs the Task. If you want parallelism you need to be explicit about it, there is none by default.\nIn the first test Akka took 3.84s while Scalaz took 6.93s. Take in account Scalaz was using a single thread (no parallelism defined).\nThe second example wants to transform Int to Int, processing odd and even elements in parallel. For Akka this means creating a FlowGrap that defines the data flow by first creating components of the Graph and then declaring the connections. Beware the graph correctness is checked at runtime, not at compile time! Adam comments that creating a component, SplitStage, was complex and more so due to the use of a mutable API.\nScalaz version of the Int processing, all purely functional. Adam confesses it was hard to write the first time. Scalaz requires us to be explicit on parallelism, so we need to create bounded queues (for memory protection) and we use streams to add/get elements to/from them. We also need to close the queues once we are done. In the code we define several components, please watch the video to see the full structure (hard to describe without showing the code). All the code is purely functional with full control on side-effects. All the connections are checked at compile time.\nIn the second test Akka took 3.43s and Scalaz 3.25s, as both were waiting for 1s during processing.\n\n\nFast automatic type class derivation with shapeless\nBy Alexandre Archambault\nModelisation: in Scala you use a lot of case classes and sealed traits to represent your domain. Hundreds or more on big projects. The usual tasks include conversion to/from JSON, persist in binary format, render as CSV, pretty-print, etc. You do this a lot, so you want to automate these tasks.\nYou could use macros, but the Scala type system is quite complex and that means you need to consider a lot of things. Also, macros have some surprises within the API (side effects). All in all, using macros to automate these tasks becomes unwieldy.\nA solution is to use Shapeless instead.\nA first example is a Printer class that takes a value of type T and prints it. To explain how to do it, first let’s talk about HLists. HLists are a sequence of types/values, similar to Scala List except its elements may have different types inside the same list (String :: Int :: HNil as an example). We can identify a HList to a case class of the same types.\nAs we can build HLists inductively, by prepending elements (::), we can define our Printer class by recursively iterating over the HList and printing the values. We use support Printer for basic types (Printer[String], Printer[Int], etc) and as we can decompose the HList into these basic components, we know we will print as expected.\nAs we mentioned, we can map case classes to HList. Given that, defining Printer in terms of HList (which is easy) provides us a way to print any existing case class in our code, including any case class we create in the future.\nSometimes there are issues due to wrong divergences or recursive types. We can make our derivation more robust by using Shapeless’ Lazy type, which helps the compiler resolve the issues mentioned before and handles real recursion in types properly.\nA caveat to consider is that implicit priorities may cause issues in automatic generation. There are workarounds, like using export-hook from Miles Sabin, or break implicits into an object hierarchy.\nThere are ways to speed up the process, for example using upickle, a project that uses macros to help with type generation.\n\n\nKeynote: Typelevel - the benefits of collaboration\nBy Miles Sabin\nThis is a different talk from the ones Miles usually gives, where he codes live. This one has slides! And no talking about Shapeless either.\nThe title was chosen months ago. This is about Typelevel and how collaboration is good. But, following Jessica’s talk, I feel the subtitle should be ‘The benefits of community’.\nA year ago, Lars gave a keynote in this very stage. I watched that video and was astonished to how much has happened in the last year. Some very good, some not quite so great.\nLet’s travel to September 2014, where Typelevel announced a fork of the Scala compiler. We wanted to push some prevalent Typelevel ideas into it, to fix some particular things. It’s something that can cause a lot of friction and disruption, but luckily the reaction was mostly positive. This shows that there is a big vibrant OS community around Scala. Shows that Typesafe is happy to let people help. It’s better to have people collaborate instead of moaning. EPFL also showed a generally positive feeling about the possible outcomes of experimentation and prototyping in Scala compiler.\nA few months later, Scala Exchange 2014, Lars did his keynote. There was a friendly panel and everybody seemed going along very well.\nAfter that, something came to the spotlight: Typelevel is not only about technology and functional programming, it also wants to promote a good environment for minorities in the community. This caused Typelevel to adopt a code of conduct, seen as a means to an end: encourage good behaviour and deal with bad behaviour. Although most of the people accepted the code of conduct, this lead to a certain amount of drama in a part of the Scalaz community (where Lars was a primary maintainer). This had some cascading effects and shaped Typelevel since them up to now.\nOne of the first things that became clear is that Scalaz couldn’t continue as part of Typelevel. Lars stepped down as a Scalaz maintainer. But there was the need for the abstractions Scalaz provided for Typelevel libraries. As a consequence, Cats was created, to cover the technical needs while agreeing to the code of conduct, thus following Typelevel aims.\nAs a result of the drama, we realised it wasn’t clear to everybody else what is Typelevel about. So we needed to define Typelevel better to help people understand us besides our technical projects like Cats.\nSo what is Typelevel? (Mind, the following is work-in-progress and Typelevel wants feedback on it). Typelevel is a community of projects and individuals organised around:\n\npure, typeful, functional programming in Scala (not in Haskell!)\nindependent free and open-source software, not linked to any organisation or company. Scala owes a lot to the community, don’t forget it.\na desire to share ideas and code\naccessible and idiomatic learning resources\ninclusive, welcoming and safe environment\n\nThis is evolving, but what is we think Typelevel is about. Please watch Erik Osheim’s Scala World talk to see ways you can build open source communities. Very recommended.\nTypelevel has always been a collection of projects. Since one year ago we had some changes: Scalaz, Scalaz-streams and Argonaut left, other libraries like Circe, Cats, Dogs, and a few more joined. There’s been new tools, tests and laws like Ensime and tut (among others). There have also appeared several integration projects, like shapeless-argonaut, which enhance existing libraries; as well as macro/plugin helpers which facilitate the job of library maintainers. A lot of stuff in one year :)\nTypelevel Scala has not moved very much due to all the effort being put into Cats and related projects. But there have been tools developed that proof some concepts we wanted in the forked compiler, so some progress has been achieved. See George Leontiev’s Scala World talk for more details. There’s been some specific compiler work, minor, but it proves we can work with it.\nSome details on some of the libraries:\n\nwell stablished libraries like Scodec (binary data, very powerful and performant), Shapeless (generic programming) and Spire (numeric library for high precision operations). All widely used, directly or indirectly.\nalso well stablished are Discipline (law checking for type classes), ScalaCheck (automated property-based testing) and Spec2 (software specification)\nwe have integrations, generic extensions of other libraries. For example, argonaut-shapeless.\nwe have news things: Algebra, Cats, and Alleycats. Cats ia a Scalaz replacement. Algebra provides a set of algebraic type classes, comprising some fundamental type classes which are then used in Cats. Alleycats are lawless type classes and instances, which are also used in Cats.\n\nThere’s been a lot of activity lately. For example, since January 2015 there have been 1558 commits to Cats by 57 contributors.\nOur guiding principles for Algebra, Cats, and Alleycats:\n\napproachability: we want people to be able to approach the library much more easily than it was with Scalaz. For example, preference for text-based operators, make sure terminology is expressive enough instead of just focussing on the mathematical origin of the concept.\nmodularity: we broke Cats into submodules so it can be used as required instead of being a massive jar\ndocumentation: we strive to have a massively improved documentation so we can convey useful information in a simple and centralised way\nefficiency: we are willing to compromise and use (under the hood) non-functional constructs to improve performance. Watch Stew O’Connors talk at Scala by the Bay.\n\nLet’s talk about Tut. It’s a markdown processor which interprets Scala in code blocks. This provides type-checked documentation, which helps us having useful and relevant documentation. It’s been even used by Underscore to produce a book, Essential Slick!\nCirce is a JSON library for Scala and Scala.js. Derived from Argonaut, uses jawn for parsing. Uses Monocle for lenses, works with Refined. Uses Shapeless for codec derivation.\n(Miles is running out of time so it skips some stuff, like explaining other Typelevel libraries)\nSimulacrum: provides annotations to automatically generate boilerplate when creating type classes. Machinist is a macro that eliminates overhead associated with Simulacrum.\nThe experience with all these projects has influenced the way we think about the forked compiler. We have a better picture of the trade offs, and we can tackle small issues in helpers and bigger pieces in the compiler itself.\nWe want people to get involved. We hope we have created an active and lively community. But we want you in. There is an up-to-date list of projects in our homepage. Most projects exist in Github and Gitter.\nNews! There will be two Typelevel summits next year!

If you go to the ScalaDays 2013 channel you can see all of them, and many are completely worth your time.\n\nI’ve taken a while to catch up with the presentations (too many things going on this summer), but one talk that I found very inspiring was the one by Rod Johnson, of Spring fame and currently in Typesafe board, about the future of Scala. The talk is called Scala in 2018 and, long as it is, I’d recommend you to watch it.\nThe talk itself shows a what-if scenario in which circa 2018 Scala has become the dominating language in the enterprise market. From that starting point, Rod comments on what was necessary to achieve this, and shows the path Scala must take if we want this to become true.\nPersonally, I liked a lot the idea about 2 tiers of Scala, one for innovation and one for enterprise. Both distributions evolving in parallel, so developers can experiment without being constrained and, once a feature is deemed useful and resilient, it can be migrated into a more stable enterprise package that follows enterprise-related restrictions.\nIn the comments of the video many people complain that the talk is very negative and it uses outdated examples, showing issues that have been already solved. This may be true, but they are still relevant ideas and the fact that they were solved doesn’t mean we can forget about them, otherwise we will do the same error again.\nAll in all, this video makes me eager to contribute more to the community. I just need to find time for that :)\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-in-2018/","title":"Scala in 2018"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-move-forward/":{"body":"Soon Java 7 will be released. A bit delayed, yes, but it’s here. Even so the question lingers: is it enough? I believe the answer nowadays is NO, but of course this is an open discussion in which each developer will have a different (and valid) opinion as per each one’s background. Let’s give some arguments for the no, then. Let’s talk about Scala.\n\nWhy Scala?\nYou may be wondering why should you learn a new language. If you want to be the average run-of-the-mill developer, no need to. But by learning new languages you improve your skills due to the exposure to new methodologies and idioms. If you’ve read The Pragmatic Programmer you know what I mean.\nSo, why Scala? Because:\n\nwith Scala you will enter the world of functional programming, without leaving the comfort of Object Oriented development. Functional programming helps scalability and testability. Nowadays, with the rise of multicore processors, using a language that facilitates multithreading by removing the need of locks and threads is a huge win.\nScala syntax and libraries reduce the lines of code you need to write. And LOC have a direct relation with bugs: less lines, less bugs.\nScala runs in the JVM, and it compiles to the same bytecode as Java. This means you can mix Java and Scala code in a program, giving you access to the vast number of existing Java libraries.\nScala removes some of the issues with Java. For example, no more need of Guava collections, Scala gives you what you need.\n\nWith great web frameworks like Play using Scala for web development, good IDE support (like Eclipse or IntelliJ) and knowing you won’t leave the JVM, there are no real excuses to not start learning Scala. Besides laziness, that is.\n\nBut that’s for geeks, no one uses it\nNot quite true. Yes, early adopters of Scala were geeks, as any early adopter usually is. But nowadays Scala is widely used, and its adoption is growing. You may not see it in “traditional” companies like Accenture. But you know Twitter? They use Scala. The Guardian? Scala. LinkedIn? Scala. FourSquare. Nature. Well, check by yourself.\n\nOk, but how to start?\nFirst, get your hands on a copy of Programming in Scala. Read it. And then start coding using Scala as if you coded in Java, don’t worry about the new stuff. Just code. Check Stack Overflow when in doubt. Read other people’s code. As time goes you will find better ways to use the new constructs the language provides, and after a few weeks you will fall into “Scala mode”.\nRecently I was in a Scala talk organised by TypeSafe, the company behind Scala. They mentioned that (in their experience) people starts getting as productive in Scala as in Java after using the language for 4-6 weeks.\nThe official Scala site can help you a bit more.\n\nWhat does Scala give me?\nI won’t list all of Scala capabilities, there is a book you should have bought already for that ;) But if you are curious, some of the features that make Scala great:\n\nClosures: Scala supports closures. In Scala a function is a 1st-level construct and as such it can be assigned, passed as parameter, etc.\nCurrying\nTraits, a type of Mixin that makes composition much more powerful than simple Interfaces in Java\nCase classes, which along the built-in pattern matching provides a very flexible tool for your algorithms\nXML as part of the language (XML as literal)\nPowerful syntax that allows you to define operators with names like +, perfect to create DSL\nParallel Collections, which you can use as normal collections but behind the scenes break themselves automatically into pieces to take advantage of multiple processors for certain operations (like map, filter, etc).\n\nAnd some more.\nWith Scala you can do everything you can do in Java. With less code, less effort, less bugs. And you can do some things Java won’t be able to do in the near future.\n\nTo sum it up\nI believe Java 7 is not enough. A good step, but not enough. And the reason is that you can use Scala. Java needs to change too much to catch up, even more with the bureaucracy associated to Java processes, and in the meantime Scala will keep evolving.\nThe Java king is dead, long live the Scala king!\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-move-forward/","title":"Scala: Move Forward"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/scala-repl/":{"body":"One of the things people love about Scala is the REPL. I have to be honest;\nI never paid too much attention to it as IntelliJ provides a handy Scala Worksheet. But it is time to fix this..\n\nThe main reason is that my old desktop started misbehaving and running IntelliJ slows it down to a crawl. While I find a suitable replacement, I had to settle with using Sublime Text 2 to toy around with some Scala code. Is at this point that my lack of knowledge of the REPL became obvious, and a hindrance. And what better way to help fix that issue than to document the relevant parts :)\nMost likely you are using the new Activator to generate your projects. Activator has a lot of commands:\n\nThe snippet above only shows the most relevant ones, but there are plenty more (278 as I write this) although just a few are used very often:\n\nAs you can see with a few commands you cover most of your development needs. But as we were talking about REPL the command I want to focus on is console, which starts a REPL in the currently selected project:\n\nAs you can see there aren’t many commands in the REPL, which makes it very easy to use even for the uninitiated. Some of them deserve additional attention as you will run them often.\nFor example :implicits will show a list of all implicits in scope. Given implicits are problematic (judging by Stack Overflow questions), this may help when debugging your app.\nOne of the main drawbacks of a REPL is to type all the context (imports, type definitions, etc) you need before you can test stuff. Two commands remove this pain: :load &lt;path&gt; will read and interpret a file as if you had typed it into the terminal; the command :paste works similarly by starting a paste mode that allows you to copy-paste relevant code into the REPL.\n\nAlongside :load there is a corresponding :save &lt;path&gt; command which saves the current status of the REPL into a file that can be loaded later on to continue your work at that point.\nThere are other commands you may want to check, like :require or :history, but with just the ones above working inside the REPL becomes a much more pleasant experience and not having a full fledge IDE is less of an issue.\nThat’s all.

But merging all the pull-requests it generates is tiring. This blog post tries to solve that.\n\nAs a note, the following instructions only work if you store your codebase in Github. Which is a safe bet, nowadays. If you use Gitlab or another system, you need to adapt the instructions to your platform.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou need Administrator access to the repository. You need to tweak some settings in Github to allow for the automation,\nAn associated Github App, for your repository or organisation, must exist. To create one, follow steps 1 to 4 from these instructions. You don’t need to configure Scala Steward at this point. We provide the configuration required later on. But the secrets must exist in the repository.\nFinally, you need an existing Github action that builds your project. This must be set up to build any pull-request created in the project. Without it, we can’t know if a library upgrade breaks the codebase and if we can merge it.\n\nRepository Settings\nTo start with, we need to change some settings in the repository.\nGo to Settings and, in the General tab, scroll down to he Pull Request section. Make sure to select both Allow Auto-merge, and Automatically delete head branches. If you see some options greyed out, that may be because you have an organisation that is using the free plan. In this case, you can’t enable auto-merge until you upgrade to a paid plan, sorry.\nIn Settings, go to the Branches section and create a new Branch protection rule. Select your main branch as the target, or a branch where you usually merge your pull-requests. Then, select the following options:\n\n\nRequire a pull request before merging and Require approvals (set to 1) . Also  Dismiss stale pull requests approvals\n\n\nRequire status checks to pass before merging. In the search box, find the Github action that builds your project. Keep Require branches to be up to date disabled.\n\n\n\nWorkflows\nSave the changes to your repository settings. Now you need to add the following three workflows to your repository. You can copy the contents into the indicated files.\nFile: autoapprove.yaml\n\nFile: automerge.yml\n\nFile: scala-steward.yml\n\nCommit and push the files, and you are ready to test this.\nGo to Actions in your repository, select Scala Steward, and click on run workflow. Run it against the main branch (or your corresponding branch). Once Scala Steward finishes, check your current pull-requests. You can open any new pull-request created, and see the build process and approvals. Once the build step finishes successfully, it will be merged. If a build fails, it will not be merged.\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful. As always, feedback via Mastodon/Email is more than welcome.

So here I will describe the steps needed to update your distribution. It assumes you are running a server (no X11 installed) and this is your first upgrade:\nFirst become root:\n\nThen run\n\nand install the package update-manager-core:\n\nIf you are running a LTS release, open the file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nand change Prompt=lts to Prompt=normal. Then run\n\nto start the distribution upgrade.\n\nEnabling PHP-FastCGI (via HowToForge)\nIf you need to run fastcgi scripts on your Ubuntu 9.04 machine, you are lucky as this version provides a FastCGI-enabled PHP5 package. To activate it: Install PHP5 on Ubuntu:\n\nThen open /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini and add the line\n\nright at the end of the file. This enables the FastCGI package. But there’s no standalone FastCGI daemon package for Ubuntu 9.04, therefore we use the spawn-fcgi program from lighttpd. We install lighttpd as follows:\n\nso that lighttpd will not start at boot time, as we’ve installed lighttpd because we need just one program that comes with the package, /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi, which we can use to start FastCGI processes. Of course, you don’t want to type in that command manually whenever you boot the system, so to have the system execute the command automatically at boot time, open /etc/rc.local\n\nand add the command at the end of the file (before the exit line):\n\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/ubuntu-server-maintenance/","title":"Ubuntu Server Maintenance"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/understanding-data-mesh/":{"body":"I’ve written a new series of blog posts, a collaboration with Chaordic, that you can read in their blog: Understanding Data Mesh.

Why is it relevant?\n\nA couple of warnings before I start. Judging by the code I wrote, this will be a very long post. You can look at the code and come back to read this post later. Also, I’m going to take a practical approach to Free Monad. I’ll provide a list of relevant links at the end you can use to learn more about Free Monad and its nuisances, including Cat’s explanation on the theory behind Free. But no theory here, sorry :)\nLet’s do this.\n\nWhy should I care about Free Monad?\nAnything related to Monads seems scary and complex for the uninitiated. Why should I spend time learning that? What’s the benefit?\nThere are descriptions of Free Monad that give a good overview on why to use it. In my humble opinion, the main benefit that Free provides is separation between the program definition and its execution.\nYou start by building an embedded DSL, which can be understood by the business. Using that language, you define a program as a series of actions that cover a business case, without any implementation details associated.\nAt this point you can test the business-defined logic in isolation (with fast unit tests, no need of mocks). You can talk the same language as the business. And only at the end, when needed, you provide a real-world implementation that interacts with 3rd party services and such.\nThis has the potential to provide more robust code, that can be tested easily, and which is a better fit to the business requirements. Also, replacing implementations (say, you change your sms provider) has minimal impact in the codebase as you only modify the interpreter, nothing else. Wether you do DDD or not, all this must sound very appealing ;)\nIn addition, implementations of Free Monad (both in Cats and Scalaz) provide other benefits, for example the use of Trampolining for stack-safe recursion.\nA bit like with Monad, a Free Monad is a relatively simple concept behind a scary name. Easier than it seems, and very useful. Either that, or I’ve understood nothing and need to go back to the study desk ;)\n\nA business case\nI’ll start with a very simplistic business case. We want to implement an application to buy and sell stocks. Our standard approach may generate code similar to:\n\nBut we have heard about this new thing called Free Monad and we want to use it. We start by creating a DSL, a business language, that describes our actions. For example, we convert\n\ninto\n\nYou can see there is an equivalence in meaning between the two forms: case class parameters and method parameters, return value and type parameter in our case class (specifically in Orders[Response]). We are converting our methods into a language, but one that has no implementation associated.\nIf we do this with both methods, we get:\n\nPlease take a moment to see and understand the parallelisms between the above implementation, using case classes, and our original methods. Note that the parent trait Orders is similar to a Functor (a structure with a hole); this is a requirement of Free, all the languages you define must follow a similar structure.\nSo, what do we have at this point? We have a language that defines buying or selling a stock. But it has no logic associated, and creating an instance does nothing (besides instantiating the case class). Furthermore, we can’t try to compile something like:\n\nas it won’t work. We need to turn this into a Monad, somehow.\n\nLifting to Free\nTo be able to use the language in our programs, we want to convert it into something we can run. For example, a Monad. That’s the task of a Free Monad, and Cats provides a very easy way to do that:\n\nWe have defined a new type, a Free Monad on Orders and a parameter A. But that’s not enough, we need to map our case classes to instances of Free. Thankfully Free itself makes this step easy:\n\nNotice that the return types of the methods, OrdersF[Response], match the Free Monad (as defined above). Also, the type parameter returned, Response, matches the parameter in the extends portion of our case class definition, which we mapped to work akin to return type when converting from methods to case classes.\nNow we can use these support methods, buy and sell, to obtain our monads. And it works:\n\nThe code above builds and returns a Free structure. This means that we can use the monads to define some business logic. For example, we can define a smart algorithm to buy and sell shares:\n\nWe are using a for-comprehension to chain a series of actions. buy and sell are used to obtain the monads that define the steps of the algorithm. As you can see, the return type is OrdersF[Response] as expected by the logic, which yields the result of calling sell.\nAt this point we have built a language for our business case, along algorithms that use that language. But this code still does nothing else than defining the steps, we have no way to obtain a result from it. We need a way to execute, or interpret, our language.\n\nOur first interpreter\nAn interpreter is something that will read our program and do something with it. Technically, an interpreter is a natural transformation, but as I said at the start I don’t want to focus on the theory right now. The key thing to know is that an interpreter requires a monad as the end-part of the transformation. This means you can use an interpreter to obtain Option, Xor, or some other monad, but not to obtain anything that is not a monad.\nAs usual an example is better than a thousand words, so let’s use the simplest monad, Id, to build an interpreter:\n\nThis squiggly sign ~&gt; is the syntax sugar for natural transformation. Note that in the interpreter we do a pattern match over each member of our language. As Buy is of type Order[Response] (equivalent to Order[String] in this scenario), the method signature forces us to return a result of Id[String]. The same for Sell.\nAs you can see, we are also executing some println statements before returning the result. The only restriction given by the signature is the return type, we can have side effects in our code (as we do in this case). Obviously this is not advisable, but it can be useful when we create interpreters for testing purposes.\nWe have our interpreter, which means that we have all the pieces we need to execute the program. We can do this via the foldMap operation:\n\nand we will see the result of the println operations in our terminal:\n\nIt’s working! We have built our first Free Monad, and it works. Take your time to understand what we have done, and remember the code is available to download.\n\nXor Interpreters\nWe have built our first interpreter, but let’s be honest: Id is not so useful, and we want to avoid side-effects in our code. If we aim to do something akin to railway oriented programming we may want to use Xor instead.\nBut this reveals a slight issue: the natural transformation expects a monad with shape G[_], and Xor is Xor[+A, +B]. There is a mismatch in the number of holes. Thankfully we can fix that with a small trick, by fixing the type of the left side of Xor, like:\n\nThis creates a new monadic type with a single type parameter, which fits the requirements of natural transformation. You may want to use an ADT instead of String on the left side, to make it more flexible. In any case, we can now construct a new interpreter:\n\nand if we execute it\n\nwe will see that the result is a left:\n\nWhich brings us to a very important point: you are using your interpreter in a for-comprehension (usually). If you return a monadic value that would usually shortcut the process, like Xor.Left or Nil or None, the remainder of the program won’t we executed.\nThis may be what you want, but be aware of this behaviour. For a relevant example, if we had a case class extending Orders[Unit] and a natural transformation to Option, we may want to return Some(()) instead of None to avoid this behaviour.\nOk, so we have built another interpreter, and it works. But our language is still very simple, let’s make it a bit more useful.\n\nExtending the language\nWe want smart algorithms, and hardcoding the stocks to buy won’t help. We are aiming to build programs similar to:\n\nSo we can start by defining a new case class and lifting it to a Free Monad instance:\n\nIf you execute the program above (smartTradeWithList) you will see it doesn’t compile. The reason is that buy expects a single Symbol, but st is List[Symbol]. Ah, but of course! We are flatmapping over OrdersF[A] and, as expected, the left side of the for-comprehension binds to the A value. In our case, as listStocks returns OrdersF[List[Symbol]] then st will be List[Symbol].\nSo what now? If we couldn’t work around this restriction, the utility of Free Monads would be very limited, as this is a common use case. Luckily, the Traverse typeclass solves exactly this kind of issue. We can rewrite our program as:\n\nand, with slightly more verbose code, it will compile. We could always hide the extra verbosity behind a helper method, if we want. We must also update our orderPrinter to tackle the new ListStocks case:\n\nAnd now we can execute the new program:\n\nto see the expected output:\n\nThe language works. We can now build our smart programs and release into production to, hopefully, earn us a lot of money. Well, almost. The programs work, but if someone makes a mistake, how will we know? We might want to add some logging, but we don’t want to use side effects. How to do it?\n\nAdding Logs\nLogging is a language in itself. We want to embed log messages in the application, but how to manage them is another matter: we may want to ignore them on testing, to send them to a log file, or even to several destination. As such, using a Free Monad for logs makes sense. So let’s define the language and create the associated Free Monad:\n\nWe have seen this before, nothing new here. We can now log info and error messages and we have an interpreter to Id that will send some output to the terminal. Let’s add some logging to our program, then:\n\nand, no, this doesn’t compile. The reason is clear once you look at the signature of flatMap, flatMap[A,B](a: F[A])(f: A =&gt; F[B]): F[B]. The initial and final monad must be the same when using flatMap, but in here we are mixing OrdersF and LogF monads in the same for-comprehension. So it won’t compile.\nThe solution, in Cats, is to use an alternative way to lift our case classes to Monads. Instead of using the liftF method from Free we will use a slightly more complex structure that will help us later to mix both Monads. Let’s start with an example:\n\nAs you can see we create a class OrderI that contains two methods which will lift our case classes into monads, by using Free.inject. The key part here is the implicit Inject[Orders, F] which, on compilation, will resolve to a type that binds everything together. The implicit method orderI is there to facilitate using this construct in our program, as we will see later on.\nTake this as a template to follow, a bit of boilerplate to lift case classes into monads, no need to understand all the details right now. Note that we can use both liftF and this new way to lift our case classes into monads, they are not exclusive nor incompatible.\nLet’s do the same for our new language Log:\n\nNow that we have a way to lift both languages into monads, we need a way to use both in a for-comprehension. The solution here is given by Coproduct (explanation on this typeclass outside of the scope, sorry!) which will allow us to wire both types together.\n\nWith this we can now define our program, again:\n\nThis compiles. We are using the implicit methods defined before to create instances of OrderI and LogI. By receiving our Coproduct as the type parameter, their implicit Inject will help us build a compatibility layer between both monads. You can check the source code of Inject to understand how this works.\nWe have our program, with both behaviour and logs in it. Now we want to execute it. Unfortunately, the interpreters we defined before can’t be used as they are, we need an interpreter for the new TradeApp type. The good news are that this new interpreter can be built on top of the existing ones:\n\nThis interpreter is defining a natural transformation from TradeApp (a monad) to Id (another monad). As TradeApp is a Coproduct, and we already have interpreters from each of its elements to Id, we can take advantage of the or method in a natural transformation and delegate the task to our existing interpreters. Reuse is always good :)\nWe can run this:\n\nand we will see the output in our terminal, including the logs:\n\nThere you have it. Two full languages working together to define a program, that we can later on run with a specific interpreter. Isn’t it neat? Although the code seems more verbose that with the original example, remember that we are defining all these elements (implicit classes and interpreters) just once, and they will work with all our programs using these languages. Not a bad trade-off.\n\nWhat’s better than 2 languages?\nSo we can build programs with two languages, but… what if we want three? We are managing money and shares, so besides logs we may be required to add auditing to the application. How easy is that? Let’s start by defining a third language, Audit, as we just did with the other two:\n\nAgain, you have seen all this before. We have a language, we lift the case classes to Free Monad and we create an interpreter to Id. Easy. The complex part comes when we want to define our Coproduct and the typeclass is declared as Coproduct[F[_], G[_], A], which means we have room for only two monads, F and G. But we need 3. Ouch!\nBut, wait! In the previous section we defined the TradeApp coproduct. Which is a coproduct, yes, but also behaves like our Free Monads, so we can consider it a Monad (I’m not sure if it is technically correct to call it a Monad, but let’s ignore that by now). This means, in fact, we have only two monads: Audit and TradeApp. So we can build the Coproduct:\n\nA note of interest: due to the way Inject is implemented, our TradeApp class needs to be on the right hand side, otherwise this code won’t compile.\nWe have the type, what about the interpreter? Yes, we can reuse our existing ones, this has not changed:\n\nNotice that in the interpreter the order also matters, due to the implementation details of or. But, at this point, we have all the pieces we need and we can build our program:\n\nand on execution\n\nwe see\n\nWe did it. We have three languages working together in our program. And the only additional definitions are a couple of Coproduct types as well as interpreters, which are built reusing existing interpreters for our types. Not a lot of work for the benefits we get, if I can say so.\nAt this stage we could try to add more languages, but we see the pattern on how it would work. So let’s try something different.\n\nFree Monads all the way down\nOur original Orders language didn’t specify how would we send an order to someone. We could code that into an interpreter, true. But we can safely assume that Orders will be propagated via either HTTP requests or Messages to some system. Given the recent popularity of event-sourcing and Kafka, let’s say some publish-subscribe system. It would be wasteful to redefine the details to interact with that system in each interpreter that needed so.\nIn fact, we can think that a language exists to interact with that system, so we should be able to define a Free Monad to work with that language. Let’s do so:\n\nNothing new here either, we defined another language, this time using liftF, along an interpreter to Id to print messages to the terminal. By now, you should be able to do this with your eyes closed ;)\nWe have the language. How to make Orders work with this language, such that we can define our orders in terms of operations against a publish-subscribe network? The answer is natural transformation. If you remember, a natural transformation allows us to convert our original language to a new monad. And MessagingF is a monad, a free one. Which means we can do the following:\n\nThis compiles (and works, as we will see later). And yes, you can use a for-comprehension inside the interpreter, as we do in our ListStocks case. This specific transformation is simpler due to the fact that publish, buy and sell have the same response type Response, but as you can see adapting the results wouldn’t be a problem, if required.\nThat was easy, wasn’t it? So what about our interpreter? How do we bridge from Orders to Id while using MessagingF? For this case we need to build a small bridge between interpreters. Let me show you what I mean:\n\nWe can chain natural transformations via their andThen method. In this case, though, we have a small mismatch of parameters: orderToMessageInterpreter returns a MessagingF but messagingPrinter expects Messaging. The solution is to create a new interpreter from MessagingF to Id. The good news is that this interpreter can reuse our existing messagingPrinter via foldMap, which means this bridge is not adding risk (as in new logic) to our application.\nIf we use all this together to run our original program, without logging nor auditing:\n\nwe see\n\nSo now we are running our orders via another Free Monad that represents a lower-level layer in the stack. This means we can compose this new monad with other languages, as needed. This has the benefit that improvements to the interpreters of this new Messaging language will be automatically propagated to any program indirectly using it, as well as reducing the amount of code that needs to be tested thanks to reuse.\nWe have one last task left: use this new Messaging language with our program that has logs and audit commands.\n\nAll together\nThe last step is to put all this together. We have a program, smartTradeWithAuditsAndLogs, that has logging and auditing. We want to run it against an interpreter that also uses our Orders to Messaging to Id interpreter defined above, ordersToTerminalViaMessage.\nTo do this, we need to define two new interpreters. The reason is that our original TradeApp ~&gt; Id interpreter wasn’t running through our Messaging language, and by changing the interpreter for TradeApp we will also need to define a new one for AuditableTradeApp:\n\nAs before, the good news is that we are reusing our previous original interpreters, just modifying how we combine them. When you think about it, we have only 4 interpreters to Id, one per language. All the other interpreters are combinations of these. Which means that, although it seems we are reimplementing them often, in fact we are not.\nWith this last interpreter we can run our full program:\n\nand see in our terminal\n\nAnd that’s it. We have defined a program using 4 different languages, used at different levels of abstraction. Quite a comprehensive case, if the length of this post is any indication :) I hope this showcases the main uses of Free Monad and gives you a better understanding on the subject.\nRemember that you can clone the code to play with all this yourself.\nNow, let’s talk about a couple of issues with Free Monads.\n\nPerformance impact\nEvery time we add an abstraction, performance may diminish. I’ve not done any tests on performance using Free Monads as doing a proper benchmark is very hard, but I found a couple of references on the subject which may help understanding the impact.\nThis Free Monad explanation is quite comprehensive, and it says about performance:\n\nDo we have to pay for all the benefits of free and freer monads in performance?\nWith the simplest free and freer monads described so far: yes, the performance suffers.\nOne should keep in mind that performance does not always matter: a large portion of software\nwe successfully interact with every day is written in Python, Perl or Ruby, and which are not\nexactly speed kings.\n\nI agree with the statement above in that most of our applications are not performance sensitive, within certain limits. For most operations the overhead introduced by Free Monad is not relevant, but don’t use it if performance is critical to your business case.\nPascal Voitot wrote last year a post on better implementations of Free. As far as I understand, some of the concepts are already implemented in Cats and may reduce the impact of Free a bit.\nAs usual, each use case is different. You should test your implementation to ensure resulting performance is acceptable to you.\n\nThe criticisms\nI’ve left this part to the last, at the point where saw a full implementation of Free and we can judge the criticisms from a more informed perspective. Shouldn’t come as a surprise that not everybody likes Free Monad, and there are some justified criticisms to it.\nAs an example, recently Alexandru Nedelcu, of Monix fame, tweeted a series of opinions where he highlights some trade offs you make when you decide to use Free Monads.\nThis talk by Kelley Robinson gave a bit more detail on situations in which Free Monad may not be a good fit. The video has not been published yet, but there are slides available.\nUnfortunately I’ve lost a couple of references I had with people raising concerns about Free Monad. But I hope these two give you an idea of the general issues people have with this pattern.\nIn the end, you have to remember the Free Monad is just a tool, and no tool is a silver bullet. It may be a perfect fit for your application and team, right now, but you should understand the trade offs you are accepting. Unfortunately you can only understand that through experience; my advice is to start using it in areas of the code where the impact will be small and spread it as you learn.\n\nThanks\nWith concepts like Free Monad, existing literature and people’s help are crucial to navigate the hard parts. It would be unfair to not mention all contributions that helped me to understand (or so I hope) Free Monad, and to write this post.\nThere’s plenty of information online that has been extremely useful. The most relevant links are listed in the next section. A big thanks to all the authors, the time spent on that documentation has helped at least one person :)\nI need to thank Miles Sabin, Channing Walton, and Lance Walton, as experimentation we did with Free Monad provided a foundation for this post.\nMany thanks to Julien Truffaut. He pointed to traversableU as the solution to mixing List results in the program for Orders. I got stuck in that case and, without his contribution, I’d be giving a horribly wrong solution to you, my reader.\nLast, but not least, I need to thank Cat’s Gitter channel, in particular Adelbert Chang, as he corrected a few misconceptions I had whilst porting a Free Monad built using Scalaz to a version using Cats.\n\nReferences\nI’ve used a lot of sources to improve my understanding on Free Monad.

That’s why I was happy to see the raise of PaaS like Heroku, which facilitated deploying a webapp without having to spend time in sysadmin tasks which I didn’t know how to do correctly and which took me too much time.\n\nUnfortunately, as with most abstractions, the PaaS environments are simple to use but also quite limited in options. Heroku offering of 512Mb per dyno plus limitations on what you can do can be a problem, and the third party addons get expensive quickly. Then you have Amazon EC2, cheaper and quite flexible, but in exchange you need a bit more of “sysadmin knowledge”. Not a big deal for apps like this blog, running in a Micro instance, but if your app is bigger and spans several servers, it may become time consuming.\nI wanted to automate the task of managing the server so I did not have to worry too much about it. I looked at both Chef and Puppet, but somehow I couldn’t bring myself to spend enough time with them. The release of Amazon OpsWorks raised the issue again as they don’t have a Play Framework 2 script ready out of the box, but it was hard to try to focus on that task.\nThat was it until this last weekend when I discovered, somehow, Ansible. Ansible is a tool in the same category as Chef and Puppet (purists will start pointing at relevant differences here, but I only care about the fact that they automate my sysadmin tasks). For some reason Ansible seemed much simpler to understand and use, and I got hooked. Ansible Playbooks consist on a series of yaml files that declare the steps to execute, in order. Ansible itself manages the execution of the steps across servers, so you can run one script on as many servers as you need all at the same time. I won’t enter into details as Ansible has good enough documentation, but to put an example let’s see a possible Ansible Playbook to install Authbind into an EC2 instance:\n\nHaving the tool the task ahead was clear: my main 3 sysadmin issues with EC2 (given my current usage level) are securing the Ubuntu AMI, deploying a Play environment and deploying the app itself. With Ansible, I should be able to automate these steps so I won’t do mistakes like forgetting one step as well as reducing the time I have to spend on these tasks.\nIt wasn’t easy (as I said I’m not a sysadmin) and the scripts could be better, but I managed to create something that works: Ansible for Play Framework in EC2. Instructions for execution are included in the Github repository.\nThere are 3 relevant scripts:\n\n\nbootstrap.yaml: runs a series of commands to enhance security of an EC2 Ubuntu AMI. I’m not a sysadmin so some step may be wrong or incomplete, but what’s in there seems to work fine. Requires sudo privilege in the target machine to run.\n\n\nplayenv.yaml: sets some Play Framework dependencies (basically pvm and java 7) as well as Authbind so Play can use port 80 without root privileges. Requires sudo privilege in the target machine to run.\n\n\ndeploy.yaml: clones a Play project from a given Git repository and deploys it on the target machine. The script assumes the repository contains a start file in the format provided with the script (see exec folder) to be able to successfully launch the app. Customise the start file as required. No sudo required, the script uses authbind to link Play to port 80. Be aware that in EC2 Micro instances this script will fail due to low memory as Linux memory manager kills the JVM when building the distributable zip for the app.\n\n\nIf you have a project in Github (or any publicly available Git repository) and an EC2 instance, run the scripts through Ansible and there you go, app deployed and running!\nSo, that’s all. If you see something that can be improved, please contribute with a pull request.

As I have some time in my hands, I’ve tried how well it integrates.\n\nUpdated 15/5/2015: Michael Friss from Heroku sent me an email regarding the concerns I raised, update at the end with his comments.\nI have a confession to make before I start: I was a Heroku convert that left the flock but is heading back to it. Years ago, when Heroku added support for Play apps, I made the same mistake as many developers before: I built my own (crappy) blog engine. I don’t know if the code is still around but for the sake of my employability I won’t surface any link to it ;)\nAt that time Heroku was very convenient, albeit expensive: $37/month for a personal blog with dozens of visits per month… not a sound idea. I ended up looking for alternatives and realised the obvious: AWS, Linode and others were way cheaper and provided much more power. So I moved away.\nRecently I’ve come full cycle. A couple of weeks ago, at a HackTheTower event organised by John Stevenson, who’s a Heroku evangelist, I asked him why should I use Heroku as it is quite pricey. His answer: you pay for a 3rd party DevOps team. Obvious an answer as it is, the experience acquired between the time I used Heroku and now made me realise how valuable that is if you are building a serious app.\nWith the advent of Docker I went ballistic trying to run things in my computer, even trying to migrate some components at Gumtree. Shiny new thing and all that. The outcome wasn’t one I enjoyed: lots of issues and nothing fully working, plus the realisation that I’m a horrible sysadmin and, although I enjoy the theory of putting servers together, I’d rather focus on developing the app and let someone else manage all the other stuff.\nSo if I ever build a sizeable app I’d go back to Heroku . With that in my mind the announcement of Docker for Heroku really picked my interest. Thus, this post.\nOk, boring interlude is over, let’s hack!\n\nSet up\nThe instructions to use docker in Heroku are missing some crucial info: you need to install both Docker and a specific plugin in your machine.\nI’m using Linux Mint, based on Ubuntu. Installing Docker seems easy until you hit this error when trying to run it:\n\nAs always, StackOverflow to the rescue. The first answer fixed the issue for me. If you see the same error and you are not using Ubuntu or a derivative Google the error, there’s a lot of information about it. Such a common error and no steps to avoid it in the installation document… ouch\nYou can find how to install the plugin for Heroku here. Run the following to ensure all is working as expected:\n\n\nRunning the app\nWith Docker and the plugin working, just follow the steps. A quick summary of the relevant commands follows:\n\nThis will generate a local Dockerfile and run the app. The Dockerfile generated is:\n\nMost of the file is just setting the environment: open ports, install JDK, etc. The relevant part is the series of ONBUILD actions at the end. They are the ones copying the contents of our target folder as the app to run and exposing the port used to connect to it. But the fact they are ONBUILD means this image will be extended by another Dockerfile, as otherwise they would not be executed.\nAnd, indeed, if you look at the output of docker:start:\n\nDid you notice that FROM heroku-docker-ef389ffce157641fd8a8a903641ab592? A bit of magic in here, but we will allow it as it is the point of Heroku: devops as a  black box. In any case, time to go to production:\n\nA new image is built (you can see the triggers being actioned again) and the locally generated slug is uploaded to Heroku, a total of 63MB of a maximum allowed of 300Mb. The app works as expected, all good. A very similar experience to what you expect with the standard Heroku process.\n\nConcerns\nUsing Docker within Heroku makes me uneasy. I like Docker, but I see this integration as trying to marry two contradicting approaches. Docker requires you to know what are you doing, you can hack it blissfully ignorant but then it hits back with a dose of reality and a pile of errors. Heroku, on the other hand, is a fire-and-forget heaven for developers: care about the services, not about how are they being run.\nArguably the tools Heroku provides hide this pain as the Dockerfile is built for you and it is a very basic Dockerfile. But then, is it necessary? And is it a complete abstraction?\nEvery time I built my app for either local or remote deployment, the build process happened locally in my machine. The issue here is that the base image (the Dockerfile generated) is not rebuild, there is no need as the key steps are triggers (ONBUILD) that will be run later.\nNow, I may be missing something obvious as I’m not an expert, but as far as I understand this means that if the cedar-14 base image contains a component with a serious vulnerability, unless I wipe all the local caches from my system (for both cedar-14 and my app) my built slug will contain that vulnerability. Obviously I don’t know which magic happens inside the Dockerfile used by Heroku that extends mine, but that doesn’t ease my concerns at all.\nIt seems by trying to adopt a new technology now the developer needs to worry a bit more about sysadmin things. And also, not critical but still relevant, we need to upload the locally-built slug to the system. This can be up to 300Mb, which kind of defeats the speed increase of doing the build process in your beefy machine. Asymmetric connections are still the norm, unfortunately.\nSo, I get why is Heroku trying to do this, but I’m not sure it has any real benefit as unfortunately not all developers may realise some implications. Or maybe that’s the point: get people on-board via Docker and then show them a simpler and maybe safer way, the old and tested one.\nUPDATE: As I mentioned above, I received an email from Michael Friss (from Heroku) about the concerns I had. I feel they address the issues and it is fair to mention it:\n\nYou stack concerns are valid and interesting, so I want to address them in detail.\n\n\nheroku docker:release does not (currently) release the entire heroku/cedar:14 that you created locally. It only extracts the /app contents and packages that into a slug (containing a JVM, your packages and your app) that’s released to Heroku. That’s deployed to the same Heroku runtime stack as slugs from normal buildpacks, and we keep that patched and updated. We also keep the heroku/cedar:14 image updated on Docker-hub for you to pull.\n\n\nAs we make progress on the Docker-stuff, and if it graduates out of beta, we’ll build supported and hands-off flows similar to how the Heroku-supported buildpacks work. (We’ll probably also rely more on Buildpacks to make the Docker-flow work. Check out how Python works right now: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-docker/blob/master/platforms/python/Dockerfile.t#L31\n\n\nYou’re correct that there’s ALSO an option to break out of the supported flow and tweak the Dockerfile. This has roughly the same semantics as forking a Heroku buildpack or creating a buildpack from scratch. Something that 1000s of Heroku users do.\n\nThat’s all. As always, feedback via Twitter/Email is more than welcome.

The idea was to try to implement a chat with it (something I’ll need for my next project) and from all the options I evaluated this seemed the best. Loving Redis so far, whoever called it the swiss-knife of databases was completely right.\n\nAs to be expected with programming I had some trouble, in this scenario using Redis PubSub with Play 2.1.0 blocked the application. So I decided to publish this in case someone else has the same issue. If you don’t want to read the details just go to the GitHub repository and clone the source. It contains a very simple application in which Play subscribes to a Redis channel and sends messages to it via Akka actors, while using a listener to notify about reception of the same messages. The Readme file gives more detail on how it works.\nSo now let’s talk about Redis and the issue I had.\n\nUsing Redis with Play\nUsing Redis with Play is very straightforward. Typesafe provides a play plugin to manage the interactions. The plugin is based on Sedis, the Scala library for Redis, which in turn is a wrapper over Jedis, the most popular JVM library for Redis.\nAt the time of this writing the dependencies for Play 2.1 are not working perfectly so you need to add an additional resolver to your project to be able to download all of them:\n\nbut once done you can use Redis as both Cache layer and Database for Play.\n\nThe issue\nSimple as it is, things got a bit more complex when using PubSub. The way PubSub works with Redis is as follows:\n\nfirst of all you set a client to subscribe to a channel. The subscription call accepts a listener class that will trigger method calls as response to events in the channel (messages being passed around, etc.)\nthen you need clients to send messages to the channel via the publish operation.\n\nSo the resulting code for subscription would be something like this:\n\nbut as it happens subscribe is a blocking call. This means that every time we execute it, a thread will be locked into receiving notifications from Redis. And the result is that Play will stop working as all threads get consumed by calls to this operation.\n\nSolution\nThankfully Play 2.1.0 introduces a new concept that solves this issue: ExecutionContexts. An ExecutionContext is nothing more than a set of threads, independent from the ones managing the Play app itself, to be used when we have slow or blocking operations. This ensures some specialized thread takes care of that operation without impacting the performance of the application itself.\nIn our case, as we have a blocking call, we simply want to run the subscribe operation inside its own ExecutionContext, which will consist on threads devoted to listening to Redis, while the standard ExecutionContext manages other Play calls. So our code will become as follows:\n\nAnd that’s it. A simple way to avoid blocking operations slowing your app or consuming all the threads it needs. If you’ve had this issue this will solve it for you.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/using-redis-pubsub-with-play-2-dot-1-0/","title":"Using Redis PubSub with Play 2.1.0"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/wardley-maps-stop-waste/":{"body":"I’ve written a new blog post, a collaboration with Chaordic, that you can read in their blog: Use Wardley Maps to stop software development waste.

And I’ve found a very interesting, if brief, comment about a new war between Apple and Google that may impact their success in wearables.\n\nIf you read this post you may notice something very relevant in the way Apple and Google are managing their ecosystem. I am talking about this fragment:\n\nA telling difference between Google and Apple: Google Now becomes a more robust platform with 70 new partner apps. Apple takes an app-centric view of the world and Google not  surprisingly takes a data centric view. With Google developers feed Google data for Google to display. With Apple developers feed Apple apps for users to consume. On Apple developers push their own brand and control functionality through bundled extensions, but Google will have the perspective to really let their deep learning prowess sing. So there’s a real choice.\n\nI’m aware that at first glance this seems a minor difference, just the standard approach both companies have when treating their apps and their ecosystem. But this week brings some additional context: you may have noticed Twitter swamped by images of people showing off their Apple watches. And, in that context, this difference in approach becomes much more relevant.\nLet’s assume that wearables are here to stay. One of their selling points is to streamline your access to app notifications, making it easier to act on them. On the other hand, you don’t want to get swamped by alerts as they become distracting and may drain the battery too fast. Thus, you expect only relevant alerts to appear in your fancy watch.\nAnd here comes the big difference in approach: with Apple you relay on developers behaving nicely and not swamping the user with notifications. You expect them apps to be smart and show only what’s relevant. This may require each app to learn about each user’s preferences, which in the current era of machine learning is not hard, but it means each app needs to do this. And I won’t comment on expecting apps not to spam you, we all have our experiences on that.\nGoogle’s approach (unless misunderstood) seems to be radically different: let’s remove the burden of learning about user preferences from the app, we will take care of that via Google Now. You just send us the data and we will send the relevant alerts. The impact for developers is massive: you don’t need to develop your own machine learning process, you can rely on Google’s far superior pool of data and expertise. And you don’t have to be worried about how many notifications are too many, Google will adjust that by tailoring notifications, taking decisions based on data that is not available to you but to which they have access, due to aggregation.\nThey say we are in the deep learning era, where personalisation is the key for success, and this includes not only your experience with an individual app but also your experience with a device in itself. I feel Google’s approach is a winner. It allows developers to stop worrying about notifications and how relevant are they, and focus on the app itself. At the same time the user will get a very streamlined experience, with relevant notifications at relevant times. I wonder if Apple needs to revisit their philosophy in this area.\n","id":"https://perevillega.com/posts/wearables-google-vs-apple/","title":"Wearables: Google vs Apple"},"https://perevillega.com/posts/web-application-tools/":{"body":"When developing your own web application, specially if you want to earn\nmoney with it, some information is priceless.

In fact it has recently received an upgrade of sorts with Edge Computing. In this blog post I write about my experience using Cloudflare Workers to build a worker that calculates simple linear regression over a set of data.\n\nIf you want to skip the blog post and just play with the code, download the source of the linear regression calculator and run it in Cloudflare workers.\n\nWhat is Edge Computing\nEdge Computing is a term that has evolved from the original concept. Originally it was coined with the raise of IoT and the consequences of having thousands (or even more) devices connecting to your servers for each task. All these connections require network bandwith and server resources, which become expensive given the amount of connections we are talking about.\nA solution is to delegate some of these computation to the IoT devices themselves, so they don’t need to connect to the server. That is, given a network formed by the server and the IoT devices, we move some of the computations ‘to the edge’ of the network, to the devices themselves. This comes with its own set of trade-off, as you need a more capable CPU in the IoT devices as well as building effectively a distributed computing cluster for some of your operations, but it reduces the requirements of bandwith and CPU of the central servers.\nThe term has been coopted by hosting and CDN companies, which now use it to refer to operations resolved in the ‘edges’ of their own networks, which can comprise hundreds of nodes in several geographical locations. The edges selected to run the computation are usually the edges closer to the user generating the request, which as a consequence reduces latency considerably.\nAt its core, Edge is just an evolution of Serverless with simplified deployment across geographical areas and reduced latency for the user. The fact AWS offers both Lambda and Lambda@Edge should be a clear hint of this. but with reduced latency for the end user due to having the server in a network closer to their physical location.\n\nEdge Computing in Cloudflare\nThe Edge Computing implementation in Cloudflare is called Workers. You can deploy workers associated to a domain in Cloudflare, and have them execute on some or all of the requests against the domain.\nFor those familiar with JEE, they work similarly to Servlet filters. You receive the request and you can decide to either send a response or to forward the request to some underlying service. Note that there is no need for any underlying service to exist, the workers can generate a response by themselves. You can also take advantage of a KV store (currently in Beta).\nYour code can be written in Javascript (not Node.js, mind you, but Javascript for V8 engine) or WebAssembly compiled from Rust. If that’s your choice, Cloudflare provides a tool wrangler to facilitate working with your code.\n\nCloudflare Workers vs Serverless\nThere are already several articles like this one comparing Workers and other offers like AWS Lambda.\nMost of the comparisons focus on the following benefits:\n\n\nDeployment is as easy (or even easier) as with AWS Lambda,\n\n\nWorkers are much cheaper than AWS Lambda. Workers bill per request, while Lambda bills for CPU used during the request. Running equivalent code in both can be 10x times cheaper in Workers\n\n\nWorkers are much faster to start up and serve a request than Lambda, up to 8x times faster in some benchmarks.\n\n\nNote that some of the benefits like speed are due to the way Workers are constructed, using V8 directly instead of containers. This means you work with a faster but specialised platform in which you will only run  either Javascript or WebAssembly. If you want a platform that can support Go, Python, and others then Workers are not for you.\nAnother big difference between Lambda and Workers is execution time allowed for your function. In Workers the free tier gives you 5ms of CPU per request, while the top tiers provide 50ms. In Lambda you could take up to 30s to answer a request (although that would be quite expensive given you are billed per time spent). The smaller time windows allocated in workers justify running WebAssembly to make the most of it, but if your calls have to interact with several external components even WebAssembly won’t be enough and you should either stay in Lambda or consider if that call should be a function at all.\nOne area where Lambda has clearly the edge is the dashboard to manage your functions. Workers’ dashboard needs some love: I am not able to see the execution time per request on my worker, and tasks like assigning routes to a worker are not intuitive. Furthermore, the editor is only supported in Chrome by default. There’s room for improvement here.\nAnother concern I have with workers is the process for managing QA environments or canary deployments. You can test your worker implementation using wrangler preview but I can’t find documentation on how to do a proper blue/green deployment with Workers. Given that they sit in front of most of the requests to your app, this scares me a bit. A faulty deployment can have serious consequences.\n\nWhen to use Edge Computing\nI have to acknowledge that I am skeptical of ‘serverless’ as I feel it shares the same pitfalls of microservices, where we went from ‘everything must be a microservice’ to ‘give me back my monoliths, please’. But it would be a mistake to ignore compelling use cases for which serverless or edge architectures can provide a tangible benefit.\nCloudflare documentation promotes many uses ranging from hotlink protection to A/B testing to request aggregation. And as per this comment Discord is making the most of Workers, using them to serve pre-rendered sites or even to override build artefacts sent to clients.\nYou usually don’t want to run long computations in Lambda, due to overall cost for execution, so the CPU restrictions in Workers shouldn’t matter much. In theory, most things you may want to run as a Lambda can be a fit for Workers. In practice there is a big difference: if your functions need to talk to external services, managing those requests may eat a lot of your CPU allocation in Workers.\nThis means that, as it currently stands, there’s a subset of use cases which are not a good fit for Workers. You may want to split your code between both platforms, taking advantage of the cheaper and faster Workers for as many tasks as you can, while using Lambda for operations that rely heavily on 3rd party connections. But, of course, this comes with its own overhead.\n\nCan we please talk about code?\nYes, let’s talk about the code. As a test I’ve implemented a small linear regression calculator based on this blog post.\nThe idea is to have some functionality that requires a lot of calculations to test the performance of WebAssembly in the Workers environment. Doing a simple linear regression fits the bill as we can work with the data the user sends each request in isolation and without requiring a database to store intermediate results.\nThe wrangler tool that Cloudflare provides creates a template you can use to start building your worker. I won’t go over every line of the codebase, but we have the following main components:\nModules linreg and math are taken from the simple linear regression post. They are pure Rust code without any changes needed to make it work in WebAssembly, which is great as it shows that we can reuse our Rust libraries for our workers.\nThe file worker.js is where we load our WebAssembly modules using specific API calls like wasm_bindgen. It extracts values from the request received, sends them to the WebAssembly function, and returns a response to the user once the regression has been calculated. It also catches errors.\nThe file lib.rs is the entry point to our WebAssembly code, and the link between Rust and Javascript. We use some macros (wasm_bindgen) to indicate this has to be compiled as WebAssembly. The code in the linear_regression method itself is pure Rust, and we make use of the linreg module. Most of it would be standard Rust in another codebase,\nThe main difference comes in the input and output types for the function, which are not the standard choices for Rust. Currently WebAssembly doesn’t work well with Vec so we need to define our input parameters as Box&lt;[f32]&gt;, which means we need to do some extra work to convert those into the Vec structures expected by our modules.\nAnother issue comes with the output parameters. Rust is not mapping Vec nor some structs to WebAssembly when returning them as a function result. As a consequence, if we want to return some complex data structure the easiest solution is to serialise it to Json, which we do using serde. Luckily this is not a complex process, but it is something to consider when planning what functions you want to define.\nOne last question may be: why WebAssembly and not just Javascript? Why to do all this extra work, wiring Rust and Javascript, while we could do it all with pure Javascript?\nWe talked about performance and how CPU is at a premium in Workers, due to restrictions on execution. That by itself may be a good enough reason. But there is more: WebAssembly has been considered by some as the realisation of what the JVM should have been, a ‘write once run anywhere’ platform. Given that, it is not a bad idea to use any chance you have to evaluate this stack. If this prediction comes true, you may soon be compiling to WebAssembly all your code.\n\nConclusions\nEdge Computing as deployed by Cloudflare and other vendors is an evolution of Serverless with its own set of trade-off, on top of the ones you have by using Serverless. Workers allow you to improve performance and reduce cost on a subset of your Serverless calls.\nWebAssembly is a great tool for developing your Worker’s code. Not only helps you obtain optimised code in a platform where CPU is at a premium, you can potentially share most of that code with the rest of your components.\nUnfortunately Worker are currently not a full replacement of platforms like Lambda as they have some limitations, both in user experience (dashboard, blue/green deployments) as in how much can you do within the allocated CPU time.\nThe expected use case is to move some Lambda functions to Workers as a way to increase performance and reduce cost, while leaving other functions in AWS. If the benefits are worth the extra complexity, that will depend on your specific use case.\nThat’s all for now, I hope this was informative and useful.
