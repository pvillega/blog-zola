# My Blog

[My](https://github.com/pvillega) personal blog.

Built using:

- Zola: https://www.getzola.org
- Theme: <https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/>

On first clone, remember to run `init_submodules.sh` to initialise the submodules added for the themes
## Important files:

- `run.sh`: starts the blog in http://localhost:1111
- `update_theme.sh`: updates the theme submodule

## Future work

- Add a section like the series panel at https://fasterthanli.me/series using the `docs` example for the theme
