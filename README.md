# My Blog

[My](https://github.com/pvillega) personal blog.

Built using:

- Zola: https://www.getzola.org
- Theme: <https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/>
- Uses shortcodes for diagrams, see <https://deepthought-theme.netlify.app/docs/extended-shortcodes/> 

On first clone, remember to run `init_submodules.sh` to initialise the submodules added for the themes

NOTE: we are not using DeepThought as a submodule as it stopped being updated, but we want to keep the layout for now. 
So it is not a submodule, but instead it is part of the project

## Important files:

- `run.sh`: starts the blog in http://localhost:1111
- `update_theme.sh`: updates the theme submodule
