It's March and Java 8 is [coming soon](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/entry/java_se_8_schedule). A delayed and very expected release of Java with plenty of new tools: lambdas, default methods, etc.

<!-- more -->

I've written about Java 8 and some of the new tools it provides in the [Gumtree dev blog](https://medium.com/@GumtreeDevTeam/java-8-is-coming-66d89c4e332b). There I list the changes along small code samples showing them in action.

As always, feedback via Twitter/Email is more than welcome.
