Iâ€™m an [experienced Consultant](https://araconwiss.com) with over 20 years of industry experience. My journey began as a software engineer, and I've grown into a versatile professional who loves supporting companies and improving their ways of working.

I thrive at the intersection of management and engineering, and excel in accelerating project delivery and seamlessly connecting technology with business. My expertise enables me to guide decisions on what to build next, and mentor engineers in implementing best practices.

Comfortable also as both a hands-on individual contributor and a technical advisor, I bring versatility and value to any team or project.

I'm originally from Barcelona, and I've spent various years in Dublin (Ireland), London (United Kingdom), and Basel (Switzerland). As a result, I'm fluent in Spanish, English, and Catalan, while currently learning German (A2 level).

Outside of clients and other work-related projects, I spend too much time on Mastodon, and I have an interest in evolutionary systems and artificial life. I also enjoy reading, hiking in the Swiss mountains, and cooking Spanish food at home.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you want a chat. I'm happy to exchange thoughts & ideas! I may be available for contract engagements; I'm based in Switzerland, but I have many years of experience with remote work. If you want to hire me, reach out via the email linked above or [book a meeting with me](https://calendly.com/pvillega/30min).
