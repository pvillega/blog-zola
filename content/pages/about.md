Iâ€™m Pere Villega, a software developer born in Barcelona and currently living in Basel, Switzerland.
I've worked for several years in the field, using multiple languages. I like creating value for companies using code. My current tools of choice are Scala ([Typelevel](https://typelevel.org) stack) and Rust.

I may be available for contract engagements, feel free to reach out *unless you are a recruiter*.
If you are one, please wait until I make my availability known to you.

You can find some ways to contact me at the bottom of this page.
