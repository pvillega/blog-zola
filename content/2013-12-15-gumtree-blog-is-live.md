It's been a busy couple of months. I recently moved from Dublin to London to start working at [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/) (and loving it so far!). If moving is always a hassle, moving across countries is that hassle tenfold. Fingers crossed everything will be done by Christmas...

I've been lucky enough to join the company at the time the team were preparing the launch of the [Dev Team blog](http://www.gumtree.com/devteam/) - Note: since then moved to [Medium](https://medium.com/@GumtreeDevTeam). I have contributed one article to it talking about the tech subject of the month, more so due to the [coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive): [Reactive Programming: Hype or Truth?](https://medium.com/@GumtreeDevTeam/reactive-programming-hype-or-truth-e6fba44ace76). Please read it and any feedback is very much appreciated :)
